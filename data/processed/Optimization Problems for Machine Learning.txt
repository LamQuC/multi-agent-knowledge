Abstract
This paper surveys the machine learning literature and presents in an optimization framework several
commonly used machine learning approaches. Particularly, mathematical optimization models are presented
for regression, classication, clustering, deep learning, and adversarial learning, as well as new emerging
applications in machine teaching, empirical model learning, and Bayesian network structure learning. Such
models can benet from the advancement of numerical optimization techniques which have already played
a distinctive role in several machine learning settings. The strengths and the shortcomings of these models
are discussed and potential research directions and open problems are highlighted.

1 Introduction
The pursuit to create intelligent machines that can match and potentially rival humans in reasoning and making
intelligent decisions goes back to at least the early days of the development of digital computing in the late 1950s
[198]. The goal is to enable machines to perform cognitive functions by learning from past experiences and then
solving complex problems under conditions that are varying from past observations. Fueled by the exponential
growth in computing power and data collection coupled with the widespread of practical applications, machine
learning is nowadays a eld of strategic importance.
1.1 Machine Learning Basics
Broadly speaking, machine learning relies on learning a model that returns the correct output given a certain
input. The inputs, i.e., predictor measurements, are typically values that represent the parameters that dene
a problem, while the output, i.e., response, is a value that represents the solution.
Machine learning models fall into two categories: supervised and unsupervised learning [99, 129]. In
supervised learning, a response measurement is available for each observation of predictor measurements and
the aim is to t a model that accurately predicts the response of future observations. More specically, in
supervised learning, values of both the input xand the corresponding output yare available and the objective
is to learn a function fthat approximates with a reasonable margin of error the relationship between the input
and the corresponding output. The accuracy of a prediction is evaluated using a loss function L(f(x);y) which
computes a distance measure between the predicted output and the actual output. In a general setting, the
best predictive model fis the one that minimizes the risk
Ep[L(f(x);y)] =Z Z
p(x;y)L(f(x);y)dxdy;
wherep(x;y) is the probability of observing data point ( x;y) [210]. In practice p(x;y) is unknown, however
the assumption is that an independent and identically distributed sample of data points ( x1;y1);:::; (xn;yn)
forming the training dataset is given. Thus instead of minimizing the risk, the best predictive model fis the
one that minimizes the empirical risk such that
f= arg min1
nnX
i=1L(f(xi);yi):
When learning a model, a key aspect to consider is model complexity. Learning a highly complex model
may lead to overtting, which refers to having a model that ts the training data very well but generalizes
poorly to other data. The minimizer of the empirical risk will often lead to overtting, and hence has a limited
generalization property. Furthermore, in practice the data may contain noisy and incorrect values, i.e., outliers,
which impacts the value of the empirical risk and subsequently the accuracy of the learned model. Attempting
to nd a model that perfectly ts every data point in the dataset is thus not desired, since the predictive power
of the model will be diminished when points that are far from typical are tted. Usually, the choice of fis
restricted to a family of functions Fsuch that
f= arg min
f2F1
nnX
i=1L(f(xi);yi): (1)
2The degree of model complexity is generally dictated by the nature and size of the training data. While simpler
models are advised for small training datasets that do not uniformly cover the possible data ranges, complex
models need large data sets to avoid overtting.
On the other hand, in unsupervised learning, response variables are not available and the goal of learning
is to understand the underlying characteristics of the observations. Unsupervised learning thus attempts to
learn from the distribution of the data the distinguishing features and the associations in the data. As such,
the main use-case for unsupervised learning is exploratory data analysis, where the purpose is to segment and
cluster the samples in order to extract insights. While with supervised learning there is a clear measure of
accuracy by evaluating the prediction to the known response, in unsupervised it is dicult to evaluate the
validity of the derived structure.
The fundamental theory of machine learning models and consequently their success can be largely attributed
to research at the interface of computer science, statistics, and operations research. The relation between
machine learning and operations research can be viewed along three dimensions: (a) machine learning applied
to management science problems, (b) machine learning to solve optimization problems, (c) machine learning
problems formulated as optimization problems.
1.2 Machine Learning and Operations Research
Leveraging data in business decision making is nowadays mainstream as any business in today's economy is
instrumented for data collection and analysis. While the aim of machine learning is to generate reliable predic-
tions, management science problems deal with optimal decision making. Thus, methodological developments
that can leverage data predictions for optimal decision making is an area of research that is critical for future
business value [30, 146, 172].
Another area of research at the interface of machine learning and operations research is using machine
learning to solve hard optimization problems and particularly NP-hard integer constrained optimization [41,
138, 139, 158, 214]. In that domain, machine learning models are introduced to complement existing approaches
that exploit combinatorial optimization through structure detection, branching, and heuristics.
Lastly, the training of machine learning models can be naturally posed as an optimization problem with
typical objectives that include optimizing training error, measure of t, and cross-entropy [42, 43, 77, 221]. In
fact, the widespread adoption of machine learning is in part attributed to the development of ecient solution
approaches for these optimization problems, which enabled the training of machine learning models. As we
review in this paper, the development of these optimization models has largely been concentrated in areas of
computer science, statistics, and operations research. However, diverging publication outlets, standards, and
terminology persist.
1.3 Aim and Scope
The aim of this paper is to present machine learning as optimization problems. For that, in addition to publi-
cations in classical operations research journals, this paper surveys machine learning and articial intelligence
conferences and journals, such as the conference on Association for the Advancement of Articial Intelligence
and the International Conference on Machine Learning. Furthermore, since machine learning research has
rapidly accelerated with many important papers still in the review process, this paper also surveys a consid-
erable number of relevant papers that are available on the arXiv repository. This paper also complements
the recent surveys of [43, 77, 221] which described methodological developments for solving machine learning
optimization problems; [21, 158] which discussed how machine learning advanced the solution approaches of
mathematical programming; [71, 178] which described the interactions between operations research and data
mining; [25] which surveyed solution approaches to machine learning models cast as continuous optimization
problems; and [199] which provided an overview on the various levels of interaction between optimization and
machine learning.
This paper presents optimization models for regression, classication, clustering, and deep learning (includ-
ing adversarial attacks), as well as new emerging paradigms such as machine teaching and empirical model
learning. Additionally, this paper highlights the strengths and the shortcomings of the models from a math-
ematical optimization perspective and discusses potential novel research directions. This is to foster eorts
in mathematical programming for machine learning. While important criteria for contributions in opera-
tions research are the convergence guarantees, deviation to optimality and speed increments with respect to
benchmarks, machine learning applications have a partly dierent set of goals, such as scalability, reasonable
execution time and memory requirement, robustness and numerical stability and, most importantly, general-
3ization [25]. It is therefore common for mathematical programming approaches to sacrice optimality (local or
global) and convergence guarantees to obtain better generalization properties, by adopting strategies such as
early stopping [184].
Following this introductory section, regression models are discussed in Section 2 while classication and
clustering models are presented in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Linear dimension reduction methods are
reviewed in Section 5. Deep learning models are presented in Section 6, while models for adversarial learning
are discussed in Section 7. New emerging paradigms that include machine teaching and empirical model
learning are presented in Section 8. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 9.
2 Regression Models
2.1 Linear Regression
Since the early era of statistics, linear regression models have been widely adopted in supervised learning for
predicting a quantitative response. The central assumption is that the relationship between the dependent vari-
ables ( feature measurements , orpredictors , orinput vector ) and the independent variable (real-valued output ,
orresponse ) is representable with a linear function ( regression function ) with a reasonable accuracy. Linear
regression models preserve considerable interest, given their simplicity, their extensive range of applications,
and the ease of interpretability. In particular, machine learning interpretability, in its simplest form, is the
ability to explain in a humanly understandable way the role of the inputs in the outcome [86].
Linear regression aims to nd a linear function fthat expresses the relation between an input vector xof
dimensionpand a real-valued output f(x) such as
f(x) =0+x>; (2)
where02Ris the intercept of the regression line and 2Rpis the vector of coecients corresponding to
each of the input variables. In order to estimate the regression parameters 0and, one needs a training
set (X;y) whereX2Rnpdenotesntraining inputs x1;:::;xnandydenotesntraining outputs where each
xi2Rpis associated with the real-valued output yi. The objective is to minimize the empirical risk (1), in
order to quantify via jthe association between predictor Xjand the response, for each j= 1;:::;p .
The most commonly used loss function for regression is the least squared estimate , where tting a regression
model reduces to minimizing the residual sum of squares (RSS) between the labels and the predicted outputs,
such as
RSS () =nX
i=1(yi 0 pX
j=1xijj)2: (3)
The least squares estimate is known to have the smallest variance among all linear unbiased estimates, and has
a closed form solution. However, this choice is not always ideal for tting, since it can yield a model with low
prediction accuracy, due to a large variance, and often leads to a large number of non-zero regression coe-
cients (i.e., low interpretability). Shrinkage methods discussed in Section 2.2 and Linear Dimension Reduction
discussed in Section 5 are alternatives to the least squared estimate. Forward or backward elimination are also
commonly used approaches to perform variable selection and to avoid overtting [99].
The process of gathering input data is often aected by noise, which can impact the accuracy of statistical
learning methods. A model that takes into account the noise in the features of linear regression problems is
presented in [27], which also investigates the relationship between regularization and robustness to noise. The
noise is assumed to vary in an uncertainty set U2Rnp, and the learner adopts the robust perspective:
min
0;max
2Ug(y 0 (X+ )); (4)
wheregis a convex function that measures the residuals (e.g., a norm function). The characterization of the
uncertainty setUdirectly inuences the complexity of problem (4).
The design of high-quality linear regression models requires several desirable properties, which are often
conicting and not simultaneously implementable. A tting procedure based on Mixed Integer Quadratic
Programming (MIQP) is presented in [31] and takes into account sparsity, joint inclusion of subset of features
(called selective sparsity), robustness to noisy data, stability against outliers, modeler expertise, statistical
signicance, and low global multicollinearity. Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) models for regression and
4classication are also investigated in [33]. The regression problem is modeled as an assignment of data points
to groups with the same regression coecients.
In order to speed up the tting procedure and improve the interpretability of the regression model, irrelevant
variables can be excluded via feature selection strategies. For example, feature selection is desired in case some
regression variables are highly correlated. Multicollinearity can be detected by the condition number of the
correlation matrix or the variance inuence factor (VIF) [61]. To achieve feature selection in this case, [202]
introduces a mixed integer semidenite programming formulation to eliminate multicollinearity by bounding the
condition number. The approach requires to solve a single optimization problem, in contrast with the cutting
plane algorithm of [31]. Alternatively, [203] proposes a mixed integer quadratic optimization formulation with
an upper bound on VIF, which is a better-grounded statistical indicator for multicollinearity with respect to
the condition number.
2.2 Shrinkage methods
Shrinkage methods (also called regularization methods) seek to diminish the value of the regression coecients.
The aim is to obtain a more interpretable model (with less relevant features), at the price of introducing
some bias in the model determination. A well-known shrinkage method is Ridge regression, where a 2-norm
penalization on the regression coecients is added to the loss function such that
Lridge(0;) =nX
i=1(yi 0 pX
j=1xijj)2+pX
j=12
j; (5)
wherecontrols the magnitude of shrinkage.
Another technique for regularization in regression is the lasso regression , which penalizes the 1-norm of the
regression coecients, and seeks to minimize the quantity
Llasso(0;) =nX
i=1(yi 0 pX
j=1xijj)2+pX
j=1jjj: (6)
Whenis suciently large, the 1-norm penalty forces some of the coecient estimates to be exactly equal to
zero, hence the models produced by the lasso are more interpretable than those obtained via Ridge regression.
Ridge and lasso regression belong to a class of techniques to achieve sparse regression . As discussed in
[32, 34], sparse regression can be formulated as the best subset selection problem [167]

to select, andjjjj0is the number of non-zero entries of , which is commonly referred to as the \0-norm"
(though is not technically a norm as it does not satisfy the homogeneity property) . Problem (7){(9) is NP-
hard, as proven in [174]. The recent work of [32] demonstrated that the best subset selection can be solved to
near-optimal solutions using optimization techniques for values of pin the hundreds or thousands. Specically,
by introducing the binary variables s2f0;1gp, the sparse regression problem can be transformed into the
MIQP formulation

5whereMis a large constant, Mkk1. Since the choice of the data dependent constant Mlargely aects
the strength of the MIQP formulation, alternative formulations based on Specially Ordered Sets Type I can
be devised [70].
As discussed in [120], the prediction accuracy of best subset selection is however highly dependent on
the noise present in the input dataset, and it is not possible to establish a dominance relationship over lasso
regression and forward stepwise selection [91]. In order to limit the eect of noise in the input data, make the
model more robust, and to avoid numerical issues, [34] introduces the Tikhonov regularization term1
2kk2

with weight  >0 into the objective function of problem (10){(14), which is then solved using a cutting plane
approach.
The task of nding a linear model to express the relationship between regressors and output is a particular
case of selecting the hyperplane that minimizes a measure of the deviation of the data with respect to the
induced linear form. As presented in [37], locating a hyperplane 0+xT= 0;02R;2Rpto t a set of
pointsxi2Rp;i= 1;:::;n , consists of nding ^0;^2arg min0;((0;)), where(0;) =fx1;:::;xng(0;)
is a mapping to the residuals of the points on the hyperplane (according to a distance measure in Rp), and
is an aggregation function on the residuals (e.g., residual sum of squares, least absolute deviation [89]). If
the number of points nis much smaller than the dimension pof the space, feature selection strategies can be
applied [32, 169]. We note that hyperplane tting is a variant of facility location problems [84, 192].
2.3 Regression Models Beyond Linearity
A natural extension of linear regression models is to consider nonlinear terms, which may capture complex
relationships between regressors and predictors. Nonlinear regression models include, among others, polynomial
regression, exponential regression, step functions, regression splines, smoothing splines and local regression
[99, 129]. Alternatively, the Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) [119] maintain the additivity of the original
predictorsX1;:::;Xpand the relationship between each feature and the response yis expressed using nonlinear
functionsfj(Xj) such as
y=0+pX
j=1fj(Xj): (15)
GAMs may increase the exibility and accuracy of the predictions with respect to linear models, while
maintaining a certain level of interpretability of the predictors. However, one limitation is given by the
assumption of additivity of the features. To further increase the model exibility, one could include predictors
of the form XiXj, or consider non-parametric models, such as random forests and boosting. It has been
empirically observed that GAMs do not represent well problems where the number of observations is much
larger than the number of predictors. In [204] the Generalized Additive Model Selection is introduced to t
sparse GAMs in high dimension with a penalized likelihood approach. The penalty term is derived from the
tting criterion for smoothing splines. Alternatively, [68] proposes to t a constrained version of GAMs by
solving a conic programming problem.
As an intermediate model between linear and nonlinear relationships, compact and simple representations
via piecewise ane models have been discussed in [137]. Piecewise ane forms emerge as candidate models
when the tting function is known to be discontinuous [94], separable [81], or approximate to complex nonlinear
expressions [80, 187, 213]. Fitting piecewise ane models involves partitioning the domain Dof the input data
intoKsubdomains Di;i= 1;:::;K; and tting for each subdomain an ane function fi:Di!R, in
order to minimize a measure of the overall tting error. To facilitate the tting procedure, the domain is
partitioned a priori (see K-hyperplane clustering in Section 4.3). Neglecting domain partitioning may lead to
large tting errors. In contrast, [5] considers both aspects in determining piecewise ane models for piecewise
linearly separable subdomains via a mixed integer linear programming formulation and a tailored heuristic.
Mixed integer models are also proposed in [207], however a partial knowledge of the subdomains is required.
Alternatively, clustering techniques can be adopted for domain partitioning [94].
3 Classication
The task of classifying data is to decide the class membership of an unlabeled data item xbased on the
training dataset ( X;y) where each xihas a known class membership yi. A recent comparison of machine
learning techniques for binary classication is found in [18]. This section reviews the common binary and
6multiclass classication approaches that include logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, decision trees,
and support vector machines.
3.1 Logistic Regression
In most problem domains, there is no functional relationship y=f(x) betweenyandx. In this case, the
relationship between xandyhas to be described more generally by a probability distribution P(x;y) while
assuming that the training contains independent samples from P. In this section, the label yis assumed to be
binary, i.e., y2f0;1g. The optimal class membership decision is to choose the class label ythat maximizes
the posterior distribution P(yjx). Logistic regression calculates the class membership probability for one of
the two categories in the dataset as
P(y= 1jx;0;) =h(x;0;) =1
1 +e (0+>x);
P(y= 0jx;0;) = 1 h(x;0;):
The decision boundary between the two binary classes is formed by a hyperplane whose equation is 0+>x= 0.
Points at this decision boundary have P(1jx;0;) =P(0jx;0;) = 0:5. The parameters 0andare usually
obtained by maximum-likelihood estimation [87]
max n
i=1P(yijxi;0;) = max n
i=1(h(xi;0;))yi(1 h(xi;0;))1 yi;
which is equivalent to
min nX
i=1(yilogh(xi;0;) + (1 yi)log(1 h(xi;0;))): (16)
Problem (16) is convex and dierentiable and rst order methods such as gradient descent as well as second
order methods such as Newton's method can be applied to nd a global optimal solution.
To tune the logistic regression model and to avoid overtting, variable selection can be performed where
only the most relevant subsets of the xvariables are kept in the model [99]. Heuristic approaches such as
forward selection or backward elimination can be applied to add or remove variables respectively, based on
the statistical signicance of each of the computed coecients. Interaction terms can be also added to further
complicate the model at the risk of overtting the training data.
3.2 Linear Discriminant Analysis
Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is an approach for classication and dimensionality reduction. It is often
applied to data that contains a large number of features (such as image data) where reducing the number of
features is necessary to obtain robust classication. While LDA and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
(see Section 5.1) share the commonality of dimensionality reduction, LDA tends to be more robust than PCA
since it takes into account the data labels in computing the optimal projection matrix [19].
Given the dataset ( X;y) where each data sample xi2Rpbelongs to one of Kclasses such that if xibelongs
to thek-th class then yi(k) is 1 where yi2f0;1gK, the input data is partitioned into KgroupsfkgK
k=1where
kdenotes the sample set of the k-th class which contains nkdata points. LDA maps the features space xi2Rp
to a lower dimensional space qi2Rr(r<p ) through a linear transformation qi=G>xi[216]. The class mean
of thek-th class is given by k=1
nkP
xi2kxiwhile the global mean in given by =1
nPn
i=1xi. In the
projected space the class mean is given by k=1
nkP
qi2kqiwhile the global mean in given by =1
nPn
i=1qi.
The within-class scatter and the between-class scatter evaluate the class separability and are dened as Sw
andSbrespectively such that
Sw=KX
k=1X
xi2k(xi k)(xi k)>; (17)
Sb=KX
k=1nk(k )(k )>: (18)
7The within-class scatter evaluates the spread of the data around the class mean while the between-class scatter
evaluates the spread of the class means around the global mean. For the projected data, the within-class and
the between-class scatters are dened as SwandSbrespectively such that
Sw=KX

The LDA optimization problem is bi-objective where the within-class scatter should be minimized while
the between-class scatter should be maximized. The optimal transformation Gcan be obtained by maximizing
the Fisher criterion (the ratio of between-class to within-class scatters)

Note that since the between-class and the within-class scatters are not scalar, the determinant is used to
obtain a scalar objective function. As discussed in [100], assuming that Swis invertible and non-singular,
the Fisher criterion is optimized by selecting the rlargest eigenvalues of S 1

criterion, bi-objective optimization techniques may also potentially be used to formulate and solve the LDA
optimization problem exactly.
An alternative formulation of the LDA optimization problem is provided in [63] by maximizing the minimum
distance between each class center and the total class center. The proposed approach known as the large margin
linear discriminant analysis requires the solution of non-convex optimization problems. A solution approach is
also proposed based on solving a series of convex quadratic optimization problems.
3.3 Decision Trees
Decision trees are classical models for making a decision or classication using splitting rules organized into
a tree data structure. Tree-based methods are non-parametric models that partition the predictor space into
sub-regions and then yield a prediction based on statistical indicators (e.g., median and mode) of the segmented
training data. Decision trees can be used for both regression and classication problems.
For regression trees, the splitting of the training dataset into distinct and non-overlapping regions can
be done using a top-down recursive binary splitting procedure. Starting from a root node that contains
the full dataset, a cut that splits the data into distinct sets is identied. For the case of a univariate cut
(i.e., involving only a single feature), the cutpoint bfor feature jis the one that leads to the two split-
ted regions R1=fxijxij< bgandR2=fxijxijbgthat have the greatest possible reduction in the
residual sum of squaresX
i:xi2R1(j;b)(yi ^yR1)2+X
i:xi2R2(j;b)(yi ^yR2)2;where ^yRdenotes the mean response for
the training observations in region R. A multivariate split is of the form aTxi< b, whereais a vector. An-
other optimization criterion is the measure of purity [45] such as Gini's index in classication problems. For
classication problems, [45] highlights that, given their greedy nature, the classical methods based on recursive
splitting do not lead to the global optimality of the decision tree. Since building optimal binary decision trees
is known to beNP-hard [124], heuristic approaches based on mathematical programming paradigms, such as
linear optimization [22], continuous optimization [23], and dynamic programming [9, 11, 75, 181], have been
proposed.
To nd provably optimal decision trees, [28] proposes a mixed integer programming formulation that has
an exponential complexity in the depth of the tree. Given a xed depth D, the maximum number of nodes
isT= 2D+1 1 indexed by t= 1;:::;T . Following the notation of [28], the nodes are split into two sets,
branch nodes and leaf nodes. The branch nodes TB=f1;:::;bT
2cgapply a linear split a>xi<bwhere the left
child node includes the data points that satisfy this split while the right one includes the remaining data. In
[28], the splits that are applied at the branch nodes are restricted to a single variable with the option of not
splitting a node. The binary decision variable dttakes a value of 1 if branch node tis split and 0 otherwise.
Since the splits are univariate, then variable ajt, which denotes the value of the coecient of feature jin the
split at node t, is also binary. The cutpoint at node tisbt0.
8At each of the leaf nodes TL=fbT
2c+ 1;:::;Tg, a class prediction is made based on the data points that
are included. The binary variable zitindicates if data point iis included to leaf node t, i.e.,zit= 1 or otherwise
zit= 0. The binary decision variable ckttakes a value of 1 if leaf node tis assigned label k, and 0 otherwise
while binary variable ltindicates if leaf node tis used, i.e., lt= 1 or otherwise lt= 0.

that data points can be assigned to a node only if that node is used and if a node is used then at least Nmin
data points should be assigned to it. The splitting of the data points at each of the branch nodes is enforced
by constraints (31){(32) where AL(t) is the set of ancestors of twhose left branch has been followed on the
path from the root node to node t. Similarly, AR(t) is the set of ancestors of twhose right branch has been
followed on the path from the root node to node t.andmaxare small numbers to enforce the strict split
a>x < b at the left branch (see [28] for nding good values for andmax). Constraints (33){(34) indicate
that the splits are restricted to a single variable with the option of not splitting a node ( dt= 0). As enforced
by constraints (35), if p(t), the parent of node t, does not apply a split then so is node t. Finally constraints
(36){(38) set the binary conditions.
9An alternative formulation to the optimal decision tree problem is provided in [114]. The main dierence
between the formulation of [114] and [28] is that the approach of [114] is specialized to the case where the
features take categorical values. By exploiting the combinatorial structure that is present in the case of
categorical variables, [114] provides a strong formulation of the optimal decision tree problem thus improving
the computational performance. Furthermore the formulation of [114] is restricted to binary classication and
the tree topology is xed, which lowers the required computational eort for solving the optimization problem
to optimality. A commonality between the models presented in [28] and [114] is that the split that is considered
at each node of the decision tree involves only one variable mainly to achieve better computational performance
when solving the optimization model. More generally, splits that span multiple variables can also be considered
at each node as presented in [38, 211, 212]. The approach of [38], which is extended in [39] to account for
sparsity by using regularization, is based on a nonlinear continuous optimization formulation to learn decision
trees with general splits.
While single decision tree models are often preferred by data analysts for their high interpretability, the
model accuracy can be largely improved by taking multiple decision trees into account. Such approaches include
bagging, random forests, and boosting. Bagging creates multiple decision trees by obtaining several training
subsets by randomly choosing with replacement data points from the training set and subsequently training a
decision tree for each subset. Random forests create training subsets similar to bagging with the addition of
randomly selecting a subset of features for training each tree. Boosting iteratively creates decision trees where
a weight on the training data is set and is increased at each iteration for the misclassied data points so as to
subsequently create a decision tree that is more likely to correctly classify previously misclassied data. These
models that make predictions based on aggregating the predictions of individual trees are also known as tree
ensemble. A mixed integer optimization model for tree ensemble has been recently proposed in [168].
Decision trees can also be used in a more general range of applications as algorithms for problem solving,
data mining, and knowledge representation. In [10], several greedy and dynamic programming approaches are
compared for building decision trees on datasets with inconsistent labels (i.e, many-valued decision approach).
Many-valued decisions can be evaluated in terms of multiple cost functions in a multi-stage optimization [12].
Recently, [67] investigated conicting objectives in the construction of decision trees by means of bi-criteria
optimization. Since the single objectives, such as minimizing average depth or the number of terminal nodes,
are known to be NP-hard, the authors propose a bi-criteria optimization approach by means of dynamic
programming.
3.4 Support Vector Machines
Support vector machines (SVMs) are another class of supervised machine learning algorithms that are based on
statistical learning and have received signicant attention in the optimization literature [59, 209, 210]. Given
a training set ( X;y) withntraining inputs where X2Rnpand binary response variables y2f  1;1gn, the
objective of the support vector machine problem is to identify a hyperplane w>x+= 0, where w2Rpand
2R, which separates the two classes of data points with a maximal separation margin measured as the width
of the band that separates the two classes. In this section, wdenotes the vector of coecients corresponding to
each of the input variables and is the intercept of the separating hyperplane. As detailed next, the underlying
optimization problem is a linearly constrained convex quadratic optimization problem.
3.4.1 Hard Margin SVM
The most basic version of SVMs is the hard margin SVM that assumes that there exists a hyperplane that
geometrically separates the data points into the two classes such that no data point is misclassied [73]. The
training of the SVM model involves nding the hyperplane that separates the data and whose distance to the
closest data point in either of the classes, i.e., margin, is maximized.
The distance of a particular data point xito the separating hyperplane is
yi(w>xi+)
kwk2:
The distance to the closest data point is normalized to1
kwk2wherekwk2denotes the 2-norm. Thus the data
points with labels y= 1 are on one side of the hyperplane such that w>x+1 while the data point
with labels y= 1 are on the other side w>x+1. The optimization problem for nding the separating
10hyperplane is then
max1
kwk2
s.t.yi(w>xi+)18i= 1;:::;n;
w2Rp;2R;
which is equivalent to
minkwk2
2 (39)
s.t.yi(w>xi+)18i= 1;:::;n; (40)
w2Rp;2R; (41)
that is a convex quadratic problem.
Forcing the data to be separable by a linear hyperplane is a strong condition that often does not hold in
practice. Thus, the soft-margin SVM, which relaxes the condition of perfect separability, is used instead.
3.4.2 Soft-Margin SVM
When the data is not linearly separable, problem (39){(41) is infeasible. Alternatively, [24] proposed a linear
program that minimizes a weighted average of the errors given by the points lying on the wrong side of the
separator. This work was then extended in [73] which presented the soft margin SVM. The soft margin SVM
introduces slack variables i0 into constraints (40) which are then penalized in the objective function as a
proxy to minimizing the number of data points that are on the wrong side. The soft-margin SVM optimization
problem is

w2Rp;2R; (44)
i08i= 1;:::;n: (45)
Another common alternative is to include the error term iin the objective function by using the squared
hinge lossPn
i2
iinstead of the hinge lossPn
ii. The hinge loss function takes a value of zero for a data point
that is correctly classied while it takes a positive value that is proportional to the distance from the separating
hyperplane for a misclassied data point. Hyperparameter Cis then tuned to obtain the best classier.
Besides the direct solution of problem (42){(45) as a convex quadratic problem, replacing the 2-norm by
the 1-norm leads to a linear optimization problem generally at the expense of higher misclassication rate [44].
3.4.3 Sparse SVM
Using the 1-norm is also an approach to sparsify w, i.e., reduce the number of features that are involved in the
classication model [44, 224]. An approach known as the elastic net includes both the 1-norm and the 2-norm
in the objective function and tunes the bias towards one of the norms through a hyperparameter [217, 228].
Several other approaches for dealing with sparsity in SVM have been proposed in [8, 88, 103, 105, 115, 164, 183].
The number of features can be explicitly modeled in (42){(45) by using binary variables z2f0;1gpwhere
zj= 1 indicates that feature jis selected and otherwise zj= 0 [60]. A constraint limiting the number of
features to a maximum desired number can be enforced resulting in the following mixed integer quadratic
problem

Constraints (48) force zj= 1 when feature jis used, i.e., wj6= 0 (Mdenotes a suciently large number).
Constraints (49) set a limit ron the maximum number of features that can be used.
3.4.4 The Dual Problem and Kernel Tricks
The data points can be mapped to a higher dimensional space through a mapping function (x). A soft margin
SVM can then be applied such that

Through this mapping, the data has a linear classier in the higher dimensional space however a nonlinear
separation function is obtained in the original space.
To solve problem (53){(56), the following dual problem is rst obtained

s.t.nX
i=1iyi= 0;8i= 1;:::;n;
0iC;8i= 1;:::;n;
which is a convex quadratic optimization problem. Thus only the kernel function K(xi;xj) is required while
the explicit mapping is not needed.
Among the commonly used kernel functions is the polynomial K(xi;xj) = (x>
ixj+c)dwhereccontrols
the trade-o between the higher-order and the lower-order terms in the polynomial and dis the degree of the
polynomial. The polynomial kernel models the interaction between the data up to the degree d. A high degree
polynomial tends to overt the training data. Another kernel function is the radial basis K(xi;xj) =e kxi xjk2
2

whereacts as a smoothing parameter. A smaller tends to overt the training data. The sigmoidal kernel
K(xi;xj) = tanh('xi>xj+c) is also commonly used where 'is a scaling parameter of the input data and
cis a shifting parameter that controls the threshold of the mapping. Further details on kernel functions are
provided in [2, 59, 122].
Since the classication in high dimensional space can be dicult to interpret for practitioners, Binarized
SVM (BSVM) replaces the continuous predictor variables with a linear combination of binary cuto variables
[56]. BSVM is also extended in [57] to capture the interactions between the relevant variables. Another
important practical aspect to consider is data uncertainty. Often the training data suers from inaccuracies in
the labels and in the features that are collected which may negatively aect the performance of the classiers.
While typically regularization is used to mitigate the eect of uncertainty, [29] proposes robust optimization
models for logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines and shows increased accuracy over
regularization, and most importantly without changing the complexity of the classication problem.
123.4.5 Support Vector Regression
Although as discussed earlier, SVM has been introduced for binary classication, its extension to regression,
i.e., support vector regression, has received signicant interest in the literature [197]. The core idea of support
vector regression is to nd a linear function f(x) =w>x+that can approximate with a tolerance a training
set (X;y) wherey2R[210]. Such a linear function may however not exist, and thus slack variables +
i0
and 
i0 denoting positive and negative deviations from the desired tolerance are introduced and minimized
similar to the soft-margin SVM. The corresponding optimization problem is

jj=(
0 ifjj;
jj otherwise.
As detailed extensively in [197], kernel tricks can also be applied to (57){(61) which is solved by formulating
the dual problem.
3.4.6 Support Vector Ordinal Regression
In situations where the data contains ordering preferences, i.e., the training data is labeled by ranks, where
the order of the rankings is relevant while the distances between the ranks is not dened or irrelevant to the
training, the purpose of learning is to nd a model that maps the preference information.
The application of classic regression models for such type of data requires the transformation of the ordinal
ranks to numerical values. However, such approaches often fail in providing robust models as an appropriate
function to map the ranks to distances is challenging to nd [145]. An alternative is to encode the ordinal
ranks into binary classications at the expense of a large increase in the scale of the problems [118, 121].
An extension of SVM for ordinary data has been proposed in [195] and extended in [69]. Given a training
dataset with rordered categories f1;:::;rgwherenjis the number of data points labeled as order j, the
support vector ordinal regression nds r 1 separating parallel hyperplanes w>x+j= 0 where jis the
threshold associated with the hyperplane that separates the orders kjfrom the remaining orders. Thus
xi;k, theithdata sample of order kj, should have a function value lower than the margin j 1 while the
data samples with orders k > j should have a function value greater than the margin j+ 1. The errors for
violating these conditions are given by +
i;kj0 and 
i;kj0 respectively. Following [69], the associated SVM
formulation is

As detailed in [69], kernel tricks can be also applied by considering the dual problem. Finally we note
that preference modeling using machine learning has several commonalities with various approaches in multi-
criteria decision analysis and most notably, robust ordinal regression. We refer the readers to [72] for a detailed
comparison between preference learning using machine learning and muti-criteria decision making.
134 Clustering
Data clustering is a class of unsupervised learning approaches that has been widely used, particularly in
applications of data mining, pattern recognition, and information retrieval. Given an input X2Rnp, which
includesnunlabeled observations x1;:::;xnwithxi2Rp, cluster analysis aims at nding Ksubsets of
X, called clusters, which are homogeneous and well separated. Homogeneity indicates the similarity of the
observations within the same cluster (typically, by means of a distance metric), while the separability accounts
for the dierences between entities of dierent clusters. The two concepts can be measured via several criteria
and lead to dierent types of clustering algorithms (see, e.g., [117]). The number of clusters is typically a
tuning parameter to be xed before determining the clusters. An extensive survey on data clustering analysis
is provided in [128].
In case the entities are points in a Euclidean space, the clustering problem is often modeled as a network
problem and shares many similarities with classical problems in operations research, such as the p-median
problem [20, 143, 163, 173]. In the following subsections, the commonly used minimum sum-of-squares
clustering, the capacitated clustering, and the K-hyperplane clustering are discussed.
4.1 Minimum Sum-Of-Squares Clustering (a.k.a. K-Means Clustering)
Minimum sum-of-squares clustering is one of the most commonly adopted clustering algorithms. It requires
to nd a number of disjoint clusters for observations xi;i= 1;:::;n , wherexi2Rpsuch that the distance to
cluster centroids is minimized. Given that typically the number of clusters Kis a-priori xed, the problem
is also referred to as K-means clustering. The decision of the cluster size is typically taken by examining the
elbow curve, or similarity indicators, such as silhouette values and Calinski-Harabasz index, or via mathematical
programming approaches including the maximization of the modularity of the associated graph [50, 51].
Dening the binary variables
uij=(
1 if observation ibelongs to cluster j
0 otherwise,
and the centroid j2Rpof each cluster j, the problem of minimizing the within-cluster variance is formulated
in [3] as the following mixed integer nonlinear program

By introducing the variables dijwhich denote the distance of observation ifrom centroid j, the following

Parameter Mis a suciently large number. A heuristic solution approach based on the gradient method is
proposed for problem (62){(65) in [13]. Alternatively, a column generation approach for large-scale instances
has been proposed in [3] and a bundle approach has been presented in [132].
The case where the space is not Euclidean is considered in [58]. Alternatively, [189] presents the Heteroge-
neous Clustering Problem (HCP) where the observations to cluster are associated with multiple dissimilarity
14matrices. HCP is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic program. Another variant
is presented in [188] where the homogeneity is expressed by the minimization of the maximum diameter Dmaxof
the clusters. The resulting nonconvex bilinear mixed integer program is solved via a graph-theoretic approach
based on seed nding.
Many common solution approaches for K-means clustering are based on heuristics. A popular method
implemented in data science packages (e.g., scikit-learn [182]) is the two-step improvement procedure proposed
in [161]. Starting from a sample of Kpoints in set Xas initial cluster centers (centroids 0
j), at each iteration
k, the algorithm assigns each point in Xto the nearest centroid k
jand then computes the centroids k+1
jof
the new partition. The procedure is guaranteed to decrease the within-cluster variance and it is run until this
metric is suciently low. Given the dependency of the procedure to the choice of 0
j, typically the clustering is
repeated with dierent initial centroids and the best clusters are selected. Other heuristics relax the assumption
to produce exactly Kclusters. For instance, [161] merges clusters if their centroids are suciently close.
Clustering is also used within heuristics for hard combinatorial problems ([101, 149]), and can be integrated
in problems where the evaluation of multiple solutions is important (e.g., Cluster Newton Method [6, 104]).
Cluster Newton method approximates the Jacobian in the domain covered by the cluster of points, instead of
locally as done by the traditional Newton's Method [136], and this has a regularization eect.
4.2 Capacitated Clustering
The Capacitated Centered Clustering Problem (CCCP) deals with nding a set of clusters with a capacity
limitation and homogeneity expressed by the similarity to the cluster centre. Given a set of potential clusters
1;:::;K , a mathematical formulation for CCCP is given in [175] as

4.3K-Hyperplane Clustering
In theK-Hyperplane Clustering ( K-HC) problem, a hyperplane, instead of a center, is associated with each
cluster. This is motivated by applications such as text mining and image segmentation, where collinearity and
coplanarity relations among the observations are the main interest of the unsupervised learning task, rather
than the similarity. Given the observations xi;i= 1;:::;n , theK-HC problem requires to nd Kclusters,
and a hyperplane Hj=fx2Rp:wT
jx=jg, withwj2Rpandj2R, for each cluster j. The aim is to
minimize the sum of the squared 2-norm Euclidean orthogonal distances between each observation and the
corresponding cluster.

Binary variable uijis equal to 1 if point xiis assigned to cluster j, and 0 otherwise. Linear constraints (73){
(74) setias the distance between point xiand the hyperplane of cluster j. These constraints are enforced
only ifuijis equal to 1, otherwise they are redundant. The non-convexity is due to constraint (75). As a
solution approach, a distance-based reassignment heuristic that outperforms spatial branch-and-bound solvers
is proposed in [4].
5 Linear Dimension Reduction
In Section 2.2, shrinkage methods have been discussed as a way to improve model interpretability by tting
a model with all original ppredictors. In this section, we discuss dimension reduction methods that search
forH <p linear combinations of the predictors such that Zh=Pp
j=1h
jXj(also called projections ) whereXj
denotes column jof X, i.e., the vector of values of feature jof the training set. While this section focuses on
Principle Component Analysis and Partial Least Squares, we note that other linear and nonlinear dimension
reduction methods exist. An extensive survey on benets and shortcomings of dimension reduction methods
is presented in [76].
5.1 Principal Components
Principal Components Analysis (PCA) [131] aims to nd a low-dimensional representation of the dataset with
highly informative derived features. Principal components are ordered in terms of their explained variances,
which measure the amount of information retained from the original set of features X1;:::;Xp.
In particular, assuming the regressors are standardized to a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, the direction of
the rst principal component is a unit vector 12Rpthat is the solution of the optimization problem

Problem (79){(80) is the traditional formulation of PCA and can be solved via Lagrange multipliers methods.
Since the formulation is sensitive to the presence of outliers, several approaches have been proposed to improve
robustness [185]. One approach is to replace the 2-norm in (79) with the 1-norm.
An iterative approach can be used to obtain the principal components where the rst principal component
Z1=Pp

components are obtained iteratively where each principal component Zh;h= 2;:::;H is obtained by a linear

PCA can be used for several data analysis problems which benet from reducing the problem dimension.
Principal Components Regression (PCR) is a two-stage procedure that uses the rst principal components as
predictors for a linear regression model. PCR has the advantage of including less predictors than the original
set and at the same time retaining the variability of the dataset in the derived features. However, principal
components might not be relevant with the response variables of the regression.
To select principal components in regression models, the regression loss function and the PCA objective
function can be combined in a single-step quadratic programming formulation [135]. Since the identication
of the principal components does not require any knowledge of the response y, PCA can also be adopted in
unsupervised learning such as in the k-means clustering method (see Section 4.1, [85]). A known drawback
of PCA is interpretability. To promote the sparsity of the projected components, and thus make them more
interpretable, [55] formulates a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and shows that the
level of sparsity can be imposed in the model. Alternatively, the variance of the principal components and
their sparsity can be jointly maximized in a biobjective framework [54].
5.2 Partial Least Squares
Partial Least Squares (PLS) identies transformed features Z1;:::;ZHby projecting both the predictors X
and their corresponding response yinto a new space, and this is an approach specic to regression problems
[99]. PLS is particularly viable for problems with a large number of features compared to observations as it
aims to identify the latent factors that explain most the variations in the response. PLS corresponds to tting
simple regression models each containing a single predictor variable.
The rst PLS direction is denoted by 12Rpwhere each component 1
jis found by tting a regression
with predictor Xjand response y. The rst PLS direction points towards the features that are more strongly
related to the response. For computing the second PLS direction, the features vectors X1;:::;Xpare rst
orthogonalized with respect to Z1(as per the Gram-Schmidt approach), and then individually tted in simple
regression models with response y. The process is iterated for all PLS directions H <p . The coecient of the
simple regression of yonto each original feature Xjcan also be computed as the inner product hy;Xji. Similar
to PCR, PLS then ts a linear regression model with regressors Z1;:::;ZHand response y.
While the principal components directions maximize variance, PLS searches for directions Zh=Pp
j=1h

with both high variance and high correlation with the response. The h-th direction hcan be found by solving
the optimization problem

6 Deep Learning
Deep Learning received a rst momentum until the 80s due to universal approximation results [79, 123]. Neural
networks with a single layer with a nite number of units can represent any multivariate continuous function on
a compact subset in Rnwith arbitrary precision. However, the computational complexity required for training
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) hindered their diusion by late 90s. Starting 2010, the empirical success of

neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer. Training such network requires to determine
weight matrices W02R35,W12R52, and bias vectors b12R5,b22R2:
DNNs has been widely recognized for several reasons, including the development of advanced processing units,
namely GPUs, the advances in the eciency of training algorithms such as backpropagation, the establishment
of proper initialization parameters, and the massive collection of data enabled by new technologies in a variety
of domains (e.g., healthcare, supply chain management [205], marketing, logistics [215], Internet of Things).
DNNs can be used for the regression and classication tasks discussed in the previous sections, especially
when traditional machine learning models fail to capture complex relationships between the input data and the
quantitative response, or class, to be learned. The aim of this section is to describe the decision optimization
problems associated with DNN architectures. To facilitate the presentation, the notation for the common
parameters is provided in Table 1, and an example of fully connected feedforward network is shown in Figure

Activation functions indicate whether a neuron should be activated or not in the network, and are responsible
for the capability of DNNs to learn complex relationships between the input and the output. The rectied
linear unit
ReLU :Rn!Rn;ReLU (z) = (max(0;z1);:::; max(0;zn))
is typically one of the preferred options for activation functions, mainly because it can be optimized with
gradient-based methods for DNN training, and tends to produce sparse networks (where not all neurons are
activated).
In the context of regression, the components of xLcan directly represent the response values learned. For
a classication problem, the vector xLcorresponds to the logits of the classier. In order to interpret xLas
a vector of class probabilities, functions Fsuch as the logistic sigmoidal or the softmax can be applied to
18xL[108]. The classier Cmodeled by the DNN then classies an input xwith the label correspondent to the

The task of training a DNN consists of determining the weights Wland the biases blthat make the model

kis preferred. An eective approach to minimize Lis by gradient descent, called
back-propagation in this setting. Typically, one is not interested in a proven local minimum of L, as this is
likely to overt the training dataset and yield a learning model with a high variance. Similar to the Ridge
regression (see Section 2), the loss function can include regularization terms, such as a weight decay term

Weight decay limits the growth of the weights, which speeds up the training via backpropagation, and has
been shown to limit overtting (see [184] for a discussion about overtting in Neural Networks).
The aim of this section is to present the optimization models that are used in DNN for feedforward architec-
tures. Several other neural network architectures have been investigated in deep learning [108]. In particular,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [152] have been successfully adopted for processing data with a grid-
like topology, such as images [147], videos [133], and trac analytics [219]. In CNN, the output of layers is
obtained via convolutions (instead of the matrix multiplication in feedforward networks), and pooling opera-
tions on nearby units (such as average or maximum operators). In the remainder of the section, mixed integer
programming models for DNN training are introduced in Section 6.1, and ensemble approaches with multiple
activation functions are discussed in Section 6.2.
6.1 Mixed Integer Programming for DNN Architectures
Motivated by the considerable improvements of mixed integer programming solvers, a natural question is how
to model a trained DNN as a MIP. In [97], DNNs with ReLU activation
xl=ReLU (Wl 1xl 1+bl 1)8l= 1;:::;L (88)
are modeled as a MIP with decision variables xlexpressing the output vector of layer l,l>0 andl0is the input
vector. To express (88) explicitly, each unit U(j;l) of the DNN is associated with binary activation variables
zl
j, and continuous slack variables sl
j. The following mixed integer linear problem is proposed

sare suitably large constants. We note that since the DNN is trained, the weights wl
ijand bias
bl
jare xed parameters. Depending on the application, dierent activation weights cl
jand activation costs l
j
19can also be used for each U(j;l). If known, upper bound ubl
jcan be enforced on the output xl
jof unitU(j;l)
via constraints (93), and slack sl
jcan be bounded by ubl
jvia constraints (94).
The proposed MIP is feasible for every input vector x0since it computes the activation in the subsequent
layers. Constraints (91) and (92) are known to have a weak continuous relaxation, and the tightness of the
chosen constants (bounds) is crucial for their eectiveness. Several optimization solvers can directly handle
such kind of constraints as indicator constraints [40]. In [97], a bound-tightening strategy to reduce the
computational times is proposed and the largest DNN tested with this approach is a 5-layer DNN with 20 +
20 + 10 + 10 + 10 internal units.
Problem (89){(94) can model several tasks in Deep Learning, other than the computation of quantitative
responses in regression, and of classication. Such tasks include
•Pooling operations: The average and the maximum operators
Avg(xl) =1
nlnlX
i=1xl
i;
Max(xl) = max(xl
1;:::;xl
nl);
can be incorporated in the hidden layers. In the case of max pooling operations, additional indicator
constraints are required. For example, average and maximum operators are often used in CNNs, as
mentioned earlier in Section 6.
•Maximizing the unit activation: By maximizing the objective function (89), one can nd input exam-
plesx0that maximize the activation of the units. This may be of interest in applications such as the
visualization of image features.
•Building crafted adversarial examples: Given an input vector x0labeled asby the DNN, the search
for perturbations of x0that are classied as 06=(adversarial examples ), can be conducted by adding
conditions on the activation of the nal layer Land minimizing the perturbation. In [97], such condi-
tions are actually restricting the search for adversarial examples and the resulting formulation does not
guarantee an adversarial solution nor can prove that no adversarial examples exist. Adversarial learning
is the objective of the discussion in Section 7.
•Training: In this case, the weights and biases are decision variables. The resulting bilinear terms in (90)
and the considerable number of decision variables in the formulation limit the applicability of (89){(94)
for DNN training.
Another attempt in modelling DNNs via MIPs is provided by [140], in the context of Binarized Neural
Networks (BNNs). BNNs are characterized by having binary weights f 1;+1gand by using the sign function
for neuron activation [74]. In [140], a MIP is proposed for nding adversarial examples in BNNs by maximizing
the dierence between the activation of the targeted label 0and the predicted label of the input x0, in
the nal layer (namely, max xL
0 xL
). Contrary to [97], the MIP of [140] does not impose limitations on the
search of adversarial examples, apart from the perturbation quantity. In terms of optimality criterion however,
searching for the proven largest misclassied example is dierent from nding a targeted adversarial example.
Furthermore, while there is interest in minimally perturbed adversarial examples, suboptimal solutions corre-
sponding to adversarial examples (i.e., xL
0xL
) may have a perturbation smaller than that of the optimal
solution. Recently, [125] investigated a hybrid constraint programming/mixed integer programming method
to train BNNs. Such model-based approach provides solutions that generalize better than those found by the
largely adopted training solvers, such as gradient descent, especially for small datasets. We note that methods
such as gradient descent can usually only guarantee local optimality (unless early stopping takes place).
Besides [97], other MIP frameworks have been proposed to model certain properties of neural networks
in a bounded input domain. In [65], the problem of computing maximum perturbation bounds for DNNs is
formulated as a MIP, where indicator constraints and disjunctive constraints are modeled using constraints
with big-M coecients [111]. The maximum perturbation bound is a threshold such that the perturbed input
may be classied correctly with a high probability. A restrictive misclassication condition is added when
formulating the MIP. Hence, the infeasibility of the MIP does not certify the absence of adversarial examples.
In addition to the ReLU activation, the tan 1function is also considered by introducing quadratic constraints
and several heuristics are proposed to solve the resulting problem. In [206], a model to formally measure the
vulnerability to adversarial examples is proposed (the concept of vulnerability of neural networks is discussed in
20more details in Sections 7.1 and 7.2). A tight formulation for the resulting nonlinearities and a novel presolve
technique are introduced to limit the number of binary variables and improve the numerical conditioning.
However, the misclassication condition of adversarial examples is not explicitly dened but is rather left in
the form \dierent from" and not explicitly modeled using equality/inequality constraints. In [193], the aim
is to count or bound the number of linear regions that a piecewise linear classier represented by a DNN
can attain. Assuming that the input space is bounded and polyhedral, the DNN is modeled as a MIP. The
contributions of adopting a MIP framework in this context are limited, especially in comparison with the
computational results achieved in [170].
MIP frameworks can also be used to formulate the verication problem for neural networks as a satisability
problem. In [134], a satisability modulo theory solver is proposed based on an extension of the simplex method
to accommodate the ReLU activation functions. In [48], a branch-and-bound framework for verifying piecewise-
linear neural networks is introduced. For a recent survey on the approaches for automated verication of NNs,
the reader is referred to [153].
6.2 Activation Ensembles
Another research direction in neural network architectures investigates the possibility of adopting multiple
activation functions inside the layers of a neural network, to increase the accuracy of the classier. Some
examples in this framework are given by the maxout units [110], returning the maximum of multiple linear
ane functions, and the network-in-network paradigm [156] where the ReLU activation function is replaced
by fully connected network. In [1], adaptive piecewise linear activation functions are learned when training
each neuron. Specically, for each unit iand valuez, activation i(z) is considered as
i(z) = max(0;z) +SX
s=1as
imax(0; z+bs
i); (95)
where the number of hinges Sis a hyperparameter to be xed before training, while the variables as
i;bs
ihave
to be learned. Functions igeneralize the ReLU function (rst term of (95)), and can approximate a class of
continuous piecewise-linear functions, for large enough S[1].
In a more general perspective, ensemble layers are proposed in [142] to consider multiple activation functions
in a neural network. The idea is to embed a family of activation functions f1;:::; mgand let the network
itself choose the magnitude of their activation for each neuron iduring the training. To promote relatively
equal contribution to learning, the activation functions need to be scaled to the interval [0 ;1]. In order to
measure the impact of the activation in the neural network, each function jis associated with a continuous
variablej. The resulting activation ifor neuroniis then given by
i(z) =mX
j=1j
ij(z) min
x2X(j(zx;i))
max
x2X(j(zx;i)) min
x2X(j(zx;i)) +; (96)
wherezx;iis the output of neuron iassociated with training example x,Xis the set of training observations,
andis a small tolerance. Equation (96) is a weighted sum of the scaled jfunctions, which is integrated
in the training of the DNN architecture. The min and max in (96) can be approximated on a minibatch of
observations in X, in the testing phase. In order to impose the selection of functions j, the magnitude of
the weights jis limited in a projection subproblem, where for each neuron the network should choose an
activation function and therefore all jshould sum to 1. If ^ jare the weight values obtained by gradient
descent while training, then the projected weights are found by solving the convex quadratic programming
problem

which can be solved in closed form via the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.
217 Adversarial Learning
Despite the wide adoption of Machine Learning models in real-world applications, their integration into safety
and security related use cases still necessitates thorough evaluation and research. A large number of contribu-
tions in the literature pointed out the dangers caused by perturbed examples, also called adversarial examples ,
causing classication errors [35, 201]. Malicious attackers can thus exploit security falls in a general classier.
In case the attacker has a perfect knowledge of the classier's architecture (i.e., the result of the training phase),
then a white-box attack can be performed. Black-box attacks are instead performed without full information
of the classier. The interest in adversarial examples is also motivated by the transferability of the attacks to
dierent trained models [148, 208]. Adversarial learning then emerges as a framework to devise vulnerability
attacks for classication models [160].
From a mathematical perspective, such security issues have been formerly expressed via min-max approaches
where the learner's and the attacker's loss functions are antagonistic [82, 106, 150]. Non-antagonistic losses
are formulated as a Stackelberg equilibrium problem involving a bilevel optimization formulation [47], or in a
Nash equilibrium approach [46]. These theoretical frameworks rely on the assumption of expressing the actual
problem constraints in a game-theory setting, which is often not a viable option for real-life applications.
The search for adversarial examples can also be used to evaluate the eciency of Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) [109]. A GAN is a minmax two-player game where a generative model Gtries to reproduce
the training data distribution and a discriminative model Destimates the probability of detecting samples
coming from the true training distribution, rather than G. The game terminates at a saddle point, which is
a minimum with respect to a player's strategy and a maximum for the other player's strategy. Discriminative
networks can be aected by the presence of adversarial examples because the specic inputs to the classication
networks are not considered in GANs training.
Adversarial attacks on the test set can be conducted in a targeted or untargeted fashion [53]. In the targeted
setup, the attacker aims to achieve a classication with a chosen target class (discussed in Section 7.1), while the
untargeted misclassication is not constrained to achieve a specic class (Section 7.2). The robustness of DNNs
to adversarial attacks is discussed in Section 7.3. Finally, data poisoning attacks are described in Section 7.4.
While the majority of the cited papers of the present section refer to DNN applications, adversarial learning
can, in general, be formulated for classiers with quantitative classes, such as those discussed in Section 3.
7.1 Targeted attacks
Given a neural network classier f: Rp!, an input x2 with labely2, and a target label y02,
a targeted attack consists of a perturbation rsuch thatf(x+r) =y0. This corresponds to nding an input
\close" tox, which is misclassied by f. Clearly, if the target y0coincides with y, the problem has the trivial
solutionr= 0 and no misclassication takes place.
The minimum adversarial problem for targeted attacks consists of nding a perturbation rby solving
min
r2Rpkrk2 (100)
s.t.f(x+r) =y0; (101)
x+r2 : (102)
The condition (102) ensures that the perturbed example x+rbelongs to the set of admissible inputs. The
diculty of solving problem (100){(102) to optimality depends on the complexity of the classier f, and the set
 of feasible inputs. In general, it is computationally challenging to nd an optimal solution to the problem,
especially in the case of neural networks.
For classication of normalized images with binary pixel values, [201] introduces the box-constrained ap-
proximation

for convex loss functions, and can be solved via a line search algorithm on c>0. For a xed c, the formulation
can be tackled by the box-constrained version of the Limited-memory Broyden{Fletcher{Goldfarb{Shanno (L-
BFGS) method [49]. In [112], cis xed such that the perturbation is minimized on a suciently large subset
X0of data points, and the mean prediction error rate of f(xi+ri);xi2X0is greater than a threshold. In [53],
22the 2-norm in (100) is generalized to the l-norm with l2f0;2;1gand an alternative formulation is introduced
which includes functions Fin the objective where f(x+r) =y0is satised if and only if F(x+r)0. The
equivalent formulation is then
min

s.t.x+r2 ; (106)
where  is a constant that can be determined by binary search such that the solution rsatises the condition
F(x+r)0. For the case where (106) are box constraints similar to (104), the authors propose strategies for
applying optimization algorithms such as Adam [141]. Novel classes of attacks are identied for the considered
metrics.
7.2 Untargeted attacks
In untargeted attacks, one searches for adversarial examples x0close to the original input xwith labelyfor
which the classied label y0ofx0is dierent from y, without targeting a specic label for x0. Given that the
only aim is misclassication, untargeted attacks are deemed less powerful than the targeted counterpart, and
received less attention in the literature.
A mathematical formulation for nding minimum adversarial distortion for untargeted attacks is proposed
in [206]. Assuming that the output values of classier fare expressed by the functions fy0associated with
labelsy02 (i.e.,fy0are the scoring functions), and a distance metric dis given, then a minimum perturbation
rfor an untargeted attack is found by solving
min
r2Rpd(r) (107)
s.t. arg max
y02ffy0(x+r)g6=y; (108)
x+r2 : (109)
This formulation can easily accommodate targeted attacks in a set T63yby replacing (108) with arg maxy0ffy0(x+
r)g2T. The most commonly adopted metrics in the literature are the 1, 2, and 1-norm, which can all be ex-
pressed with continuous variables, as shown in [206]. The 2-norm makes the objective function of the outer-level
optimization problem quadratic.
In order to express the logical constraint (108) in a mathematical programming formulation, problem
(107){(109) can be cast as the bilevel optimization problem
min

x+r2 ; (114)
s2f0;1g; (115)
where>0 is a small constant, zis a decision variable representing the classied label, Mis a big-M coecient,
andsis a binary variable that enforces one of the constraints (111){(112) which express the condition of
misclassication z6=y. The complexity of the inner-level optimization problem is dependent on the scoring
functions. Given that the upper-level feasibility set  is typically continuous and the lower-level variable y0
ranges on a discrete set, the problem is in fact a continuous discrete bilevel programming problem [93] with
convex quadratic function [90], which requires dedicated reformulations or approximations [64, 113, 130].
We introduce an alternative mathematical formulation for nding untargeted adversarial examples satisfying
condition (108). A perturbed input x0=x+rfor a sample xclassied with label y2 is an untargeted
adversarial example if the classied label of x0is dierent from y. This condition is equivalent to
9y02nfygs.t.fy0(x0)>fy(x0): (116)
23Condition (116) is an existence condition, which can be formalized by introducing the functions ~ y0(r) =
ReLU (fy0(x+r) fy(x+r)),y02nfyg, and the condition
X
y02nfyg~y0(r)>; (117)
where parameter  >0 enforces that at least one ~ y0function has to be activated for a perturbation r. Therefore,
untargeted adversarial examples can be found from formulation (107){(109) by replacing condition (108) with
the linear condition (117) and adding jj 1 functions ~ y0(r). The complexity of this approach depends on the
scoring functions fy0. The extra ReLU functions ~can be expressed as a mixed integer formulation as done in
problem (89){(94).
7.3 Adversarial robustness
Another interesting line of research motivated by adversarial learning deals with adversarial training, which
consists of techniques to make a neural network robust to adversarial attacks. The problem of measuring the
robustness of a neural network is formalized in [17]. The pointwise robustness evaluates if the classier fonx
is robust for \small" perturbations. Formally, fis said to be ( x;)-robust if
y0=y;8x0s.t.kx0 xk1: (118)
Then, the pointwise robustness (f;x) is the minimum for whichffails to be ( x;)-robust:
(f;x) = inff0jfis not (x;)-robustg: (119)
As detailed in [17], is computed by expressing (119) as a constraint satisability problem. By imposing a
bound on the perturbation, an estimation of the pointwise robustness can be performed by solving a MIP [65].
A widely known defense technique is to augment the training data with adversarial examples; this however
does not oer robustness guarantees on novel kinds of attacks. The adversarial training of neural network via
robust optimization is investigated in [162]. In this setting, the goal is to train a neural network to be resistant
to all attacks belonging to a certain class of perturbations. Particularly, the adversarial robustness with a
saddle point (min-max) formulation is studied in [162] which is obtained by augmenting the Empirical Risk
Minimization paradigm.
Let2Rpbe the set of model parameters to be learned, and L(;x;y) be the loss function considered in
the training phase (e.g., the cross-entropy loss) for training examples x2Xand labelsy2, and letSbe
the set of allowed perturbations (e.g., an L1ball). The aim is to minimize the worst expected adversarial loss
on the set of inputs perturbed by S
min
E(x;y)h
max
r2SL(;x+r;y)i
; (120)
where the expectation value is computed on the distribution of the training samples. The saddle point problem
(120) is viewed as the composition of an inner maximization and an outer minimization problem. The inner
problem corresponds to attacking a trained neural network by means of the perturbations S. The outer
problem deals with the training of the classier in a robust manner. The importance of formulation (120)
stems both from the formalization of adversarial training and from the quantication of the robustness given
by the objective function value on the chosen class of perturbations. To nd solutions to (120) in a reasonable
time, the structure of the local minima of the loss function can be explored.
Another robust training approach consists of optimizing the model parameters with respect to worst-case
data [194]. This is formalized by introducing a perturbation set Sxfor each training example x. The aim is
then to optimize
min
X
x2Xmax
r2SxL(;x+r;y): (121)
An alternating ascent and descent steps procedure can be used to solve (121) with the loss function approxi-
mated by the rst-order Taylor expansion around the training points.
247.4 Data Poisoning
A popular class of attacks for decreasing the training accuracy of classiers is that of data poisoning, which
was rst studied for SVMs [36]. A data poisoning attack consists of hiding corrupted, altered or noisy data in
the training dataset. In [200], worst-case bounds on the ecacy of a class of causative data poisoning attacks
are studied. The causative attacks [15] proceed as follow:
•a clean training dataset   Cwithndata points drawn by a data-generating distribution is generated
•the attacker adds malicious examples   Mto  C, to let the defender (learner) learn a bad model
•the defender learns model with parameters ^from the full dataset   =   C[ M, reporting a test loss
L(^).
Data poisoning can be viewed as a game between the attacker and the defender players, where the defender
wants to minimize L(^), and the attacker seeks to maximize it. As discussed in [200], data sanitization defenses
to limit the increase of test loss L(^) include two steps: (i) data cleaning (e.g., removing outliers which are
likely to be poisoned examples), to produce a feasible dataset  0, and (ii) minimizing a margin-based loss on
the cleaned dataset   \ 0. The learned model is then ^= arg min2L(;  \ 0).
Poisoning attacks can also be performed in semi-online oronline fashion, where training data is processed in
a streaming manner, and not in xed batches (i.e., oine). In the semi-online context, the attacker can modify
part of the training data stream so as to maximize the classication loss, and the evaluation of the objective
(loss) is done only at the end of the training. In the fully-online scenario, the classier is instead updated and
evaluated during the training process. In [218], a white-box attacker's behavior in online learning for a linear
classierwTx(e.g., SVM with binary labels y2f  1;+1g) is formulated. The attacker knows the order in
which the training data is processed by the learner. The data stream Sarrives inTinstants (S=fS1;:::;STg,
withSt= (Xt;yt)) and the classication weights are updated using an online gradient descent algorithm [227]
such thatwt+1=wt t(rL(wt;(xt;yt))) +r
(wt);where 
 is a regularization function, tis the step length
of the iterate update, and Lis a convex loss function. Let  ;
Tbe the cleaned dataset at time T(which can be
obtained, for instance, via the sphere and slab defenses), Ube a given upper bound on the number of changed
examples in   due to data sanitization, gbe the attacker's objective (e.g., classication error on the test set),
jjbe the cardinality of a set. The semi-online attacker optimization problem can then be formulated as
max

s.t.jfSn gjU; (123)
wt=w0 t 1X
=0(rL(!;S) +rL(w));1tT: (124)
Compared to the oine case, the weights wtto be learned are a complex function of the data stream S,
which makes the gradient computation more challenging and the KKT conditions do not hold. The optimization
problem can be simplied by considering a convex surrogate for the objective function, given by the logistic loss.
In addition, the expectation is conducted over a separate validation dataset and a label inversion procedure is
implemented to cope with the multiple local maxima of the classier function. The fully-online case can also
be addressed by replacing objective (122) withTX
t=1g(wt):
8 Emerging Paradigms
8.1 Machine Teaching
In all Machine Learning tasks discussed so far, the size of the training set of the machine learning models
has been considered as a hyperparameter. The Teaching Dimension problem identies the minimum size of a
training set to correctly teach a model [107, 196]. The teaching dimension of linear learners, such as Ridge
regression, SVM, and logistic regression has been recently discussed in [157]. With the intent to generalize
the teaching dimension problem to a variety of teaching tasks, [225] and [226] provide the Machine Teaching
framework. Machine Teaching is essentially an inverse problem to Machine Learning. While in a learning task,
the training dataset   = ( X;y) is given and the model parameters =have to be determined, the role of a
teacher is to let a learner approximately learn a given model by providing a proper set   of training examples
25(also called teaching dataset in this context). A Machine Teaching task requires to select: i) a Teaching Risk TR
expressing the error of the learner, with respect to model ; ii) a Teaching Cost TC expressing the convenience
of the teaching dataset, from the prospective of the teacher, weighted by a regularization factor ; iii) a learner
L.
Formally, machine teaching can be cast as a bilevel optimization problem
min
 ;TR() +TC( ) (125)
s.t.= L( ): (126)
The upper optimization is the teacher's problem and the lower optimization L( ) is the learner's machine
learning problem. The teacher is aware of the learner, which could be a classier (such as those of Section 3) or
a deep neural network. Machine teaching encompasses a wide variety of applications, such as data poisoning
attacks, computer tutoring systems, and adversarial training.
Problem (125){(126) is, in general, challenging to solve. However, for certain convex learners, one can
replace the lower problem by the corresponding KKT conditions, and reduce the problem to a single level
formulation. The teacher is typically optimizing over a discrete space of teaching sets, hence, for some problem
instances, the submodularity properties of the problem may be explored. For problems with a small teaching
set, it is possible to formulate the teaching problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program. The computation of
the optimal training set remains, in general, an open problem, and is especially challenging in the case where
the learning algorithm does not have a closed-form solution with respect to the training set [225].
The minimization of teaching cost can be directly enforced in the constrained formulation
min
 ;TC( ) (127)
s.t. TR(); (128)
= L( ); (129)
which allows for either approximate or exact teaching. Alternatively, given a teaching budget B, the learning
is performed via the constrained formulation
min
 ;TR() (130)
s.t. TC( )B; (131)
= L( ): (132)
Other variants consider multiple learners to be taught by the same teacher (i.e., common teaching set). The
teacher can aim to optimize for the worst learner (minimax risk), or the average learner (Bayes risk). For the
teaching dimension problem, the teaching cost is the cardinality of the teaching dataset, namely its 0-norm.
If the empirical minimization loss Lis guiding the learning process, and is the regularization weight, then
teaching dimension problem can be formulated as
min
 ;^k k0 (133)
s.t.k^ k2
2; (134)
^2argmin2X
x2XL(;x) +kk2
2: (135)
Machine teaching approaches tailored to specic learners have also been explored in the literature. In [223],
a method is proposed for the Bayesian learners, while [180] focuses on Generalized Context Model learners.
In [165], the bilevel optimization of machine teaching is explored to devise optimal data poisoning attacks for
a broad family of learners (i.e., SVM, logistic regression, linear regression). The attacker seeks the minimum
training set poisoning to attack the learned model. By using the KKT conditions of the learner's problem, the
bilevel formulation is turned into a single level optimization problem.
8.2 Empirical Model Learning
Empirical model learning (EML) aims to integrate machine learning models in combinatorial optimization in
order to support decision-making in high-complexity systems through prescriptive analytics. This goes beyond
26the traditional what-if approaches where a predictive model (e.g., a simulation model) is used to estimate the
parameters of an optimization model. A general framework for an EML approach is provided in [159] and
requires the following:
•A vectorofndecision variables i, withifeasible over the domain Di.
•A mathematical encoding hof the Machine Learning model.
•A vectorzof observables obtained from h.
•Logical predicates gj(;z) such as mathematical programming inequalities or combinatorial restrictions
in constraint programming.
•A cost function f(;z).
EML then solves the following optimization problem
minf(;z) (136)
s.t.gj(;z)8j2J; (137)
z=h(); (138)
i2Di8i= 1;:::;n: (139)
The combinatorial structure of the problem is dened by (136), (137), and (139) while (138) embeds the
empirical machine learning model in the combinatorial problem. Embedding techniques for neural networks
and decision trees are presented in [159] using optimization approaches that include mixed integer nonlinear
programming, constraint programming, and SAT Modulo Theories, and local search.
8.3 Bayesian Network Structure Learning
Bayesian networks are a class of models that represent cause-eect relationships. These networks are learned
by deriving the causal relationships from data. A Bayesian network is visually represented as a direct acyclic
graphG(N;E ) where each of the nodes in Ncorresponds to one variable and the edges Eare directional
relations that indicate the cause and eect relationships among the variables. A conditional probability distri-
bution is associated with every node/variables and along with the network structure expresses the conditional
dependencies among all the variables. A main challenge in learning Bayesian networks is learning the net-
work structure from the data. This is known as the Bayesian network structure learning problem. Finding
the optimal Bayesian network structure is NP-hard [66]. Mixed integer programming formulations of the
Bayesian network structure learning have been proposed [14] and solved by using relaxations [127], cutting
planes [16, 52, 78], and heuristics [102, 222].
The case of learning Bayesian network structures when the width of the tree is bounded by a small constant
is computationally tractable [177, 179]. The bounded tree-width case is thus a restriction on the Bayesian
network structure that limits the ability to represent exactly the underlying distribution of the data with the
aim to achieve reasonable computational performance when computing the network structure. Following [177],
to formulate the Bayesian network structure learning problem with a maximum tree-width w, the following
binary variables are dened
pit=(
1 ifPitis the parent set of node i
0 otherwise
wherei2NandPitis a parent set for node i. For each node i, the collection of parent sets is denoted as Pi
and is assumed to be available (i.e., enumerated beforehand). Thus Pit2Piwitht= 1;:::;ri, andri=jPij
wherePiN. Additional auxiliary variables zi2[0;jNj],vi2[0;jNj] wherejNjdenotes the number of nodes
inN, andyij2f0;1gare introduced to enforce the tree-width and directed acyclic graph conditions. The
problem is formulated as

zi2[0;jNj]; vi2[0;jNj]; yij2f0;1g; pit2f0;1g 8i;j2N;8t= 1;:::;ri: (148)
The objective function (140) maximizes the score of the acyclic graph where si() is a score function that can
be eciently computed for every node i2N[52]. Constraints (141){(143) enforce a maximum tree-width w
while constraints (144){(145) enforce the directed acyclic graph condition. Constraints (146){(147) enforce the
relationship between the pandyvariables and nally constraints (148) set the variable bounds and binary
conditions. Another formulation for the bounded tree-width problem has been proposed in [179] and includes
an exponential number of constraints which are separated in a branch-and-cut framework. Both formulations
however become computationally demanding as the number of features in the data set grows and with an
increase in the tree-width limit. Several search heuristics have also been proposed as solution approaches
[177, 176, 190].
9 Conclusions
Mathematical programming constitutes a fundamental aspect of many machine learning models where the
training of these models is a large scale optimization problem. This paper surveyed a wide range of machine
learning models namely regression, classication, clustering, and deep learning as well as the new emerg-
ing paradigms of machine teaching and empirical model learning. The important mathematical optimization
models for expressing these machine learning models are presented and discussed. Exploiting the large scale
optimization formulations and devising model specic solution approaches is an important line of research par-
ticularly beneting from the maturity of commercial optimization software to solve the problems to optimality
or to devise eective heuristics. However, as highlighted in [155, 184], providing quantitative performance
bounds remains an open problem. The nonlinearity of the models, the associated uncertainty of the data, as
well as the scale of the problems represent some of the very important and compelling challenges to the math-
ematical optimization community. Furthermore, bilevel formulations play a big role in adversarial learning
[116], including adversarial training, data poisoning and neural network robustness.
Based on this survey, we summarize the distinctive features and the potential open machine learning
problems that may benet from the advances in computational optimization.
•Regression. The typical approaches to avoid overtting and to handle uncertainty in the data include
shrinkage methods and dimension reduction. These approaches can all be posed as mathematical pro-
gramming models. General non-convex regularization to enforce sparsity without incurring shrinkage and
bias (such as in lasso and ridge regularization) remain computationally challenging to solve to optimality.
Investigating tighter relaxations and exact solution approaches continue to be an active line of research
[7].
•Classication. Classication problems can also be naturally formulated as optimization problems.
Support vector machines in particular have been well studied in the optimization literature. Similar to
regression, classier sparsity is one important approach to avoid overtting. Additionally, exploiting the
kernel tricks is key as nonlinear separators are obtained without additional complexity. However, when
posed as an optimization problem, it is still unclear how to exploit kernel tricks in sparse SVM optimiza-
tion models. Another advantage to express machine learning problems as optimization problems and in
particular classication problems is to account for inaccuracies in the data. Handling data uncertainty is
a deeply explored eld in the optimization literature and several practical approaches have been presented
to handle uncertainty through robust and stochastic optimization. Such advances in the optimization
literature are currently being investigated to improve over the standard approaches [29].
•Clustering. Clustering problems are in general formulated as MINLPs that are hard to solve to opti-
mality. The challenges include handling the non-convexity as well as the large scale instances which is
a challenge even for linear variants such as the capacitated centred clustering (formulated as a binary
28linear model). Especially for large-scale instances, heuristics are typically devised. Exact approaches for
clustering received less attention in the literature.
•DNNs architectures as MIPs . The advantage of mathematical programming approaches to model
DNNs has only been showcased for relatively small size data sets due to the scale of the underlying
optimization model. Furthermore, expressing misclassication conditions for adversarial examples in a
non-restrictive manner, and handling the uncertainty in the training data are open problems in this
context.
•Adversarial learning and adversarial robustness. Optimization models for the search for adver-
sarial examples are important to identify and subsequently protect against novel sets of attacks. The
complexity of the mathematical models in this context is highly dependent on the the classier func-
tion. Untargeted attacks received less attention in the literature, and the mathematical programming
formulation (110){(114) has been introduced in section 7.2. Furthermore, designing models robust to
adversarial attacks is a two-player game, which can be cast as a bilevel optimization problem. The loss
function adopted by the learner is one main complexity for the resulting mathematical model and solution
approaches remain to be investigated.
•Data poisoning : Similar to adversarial robustness, defending against the poisoning of the training
data is a two-player game. The case of online data retrieval is especially challenging for gradient-based
algorithms as the KKT conditions do not hold.
•Activation ensembles. Activation ensembles seek a trade-o between the classier accuracy and
computational feasibility of training with a mathematical programming approach. Adopting activation
ensembles to train large DNNs have not been investigated yet.
•Machine teaching. Posed as a bilevel optimization problem, one of the challenges in machine teaching
is to devise computationally tractable single-level formulations that model the learner, the teaching risk,
and the teaching cost. Machine teaching also generalizes a number of two-player games that are important
in practice including data poisoning and adversarial training.
•Empirical model learning. This emerging paradigm can be seen as the bridge combining machine
learning for parameter estimation and operations research for optimization. As such, theoretical and
practical challenges remain to be investigated to propose prescriptive analytics models jointly combining
learning and optimization in practical applications.
While this survey does not discuss numerical optimization techniques since they were recently reviewed in
[43, 77, 221], we note the fundamental role of the stochastic gradient algorithm [186] and its variants on large
scale machine learning. We also highlight the potential impact of machine learning on advancing the solution
approaches of mathematical programming [95, 96].
This survey has also focused on the learning process (loss minimization), however we note that challenging
optimization problems also appear in the inference process, i.e., energy minimization (see [151] for a compre-
hensive survey). In the inference step, the best output yis chosen from among all possible outputs given
a certain input xsuch that an \energy function" is minimized. The energy function provides a measure of
the goodness of a particular conguration of the input and output variables. Energy optimization constitute
a common framework for machine learning where the training of a model aims at nding the optimal energy
function.
A key part of most machine learning approaches is the choice of the hyperparameters of the learning
model. The Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) is usually driven by the data scientist's experience and the
characteristics of the dataset and typically follows heuristic rules or cross-validation approaches. Alternatively,
the HPO problem can be modeled as a box-constrained mathematical optimization problem [83], or as a
bilevel optimization problem as discussed in [98, 144, 171], which provides theoretical convergence guarantees
in addition to computational advantage. Automated approaches for HPO are also an active area of research
in Machine Learning [26, 92, 220].
Finally, since the recent widespread of machine learning to several research disciplines and in the mainstream
industry can be largely attributed to the availability of data and the relatively easy to use libraries, we
summarize in the online supplement the resources that may be of value for research.
