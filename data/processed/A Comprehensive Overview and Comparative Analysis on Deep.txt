1 Introduction  
Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to emulate human -level intelligence in machines. In computer 
science, AI refers to the study of "intelligent agents," which are objects capable of perceiving their 
environment and taking actions to maximize their chances o f achieving specific goals [1]. Machine 
learning (ML) is a field that focuses on the development and application of methods capable of 
learning from datasets  [2]. ML finds extensive use in various domains, such as speech recognition, ABSTRACT  
Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful subset of machine learning (ML) and artificial 
intelligence (AI), outperforming traditional ML methods, especially in handling unstructured and large 
datasets. Its impact spans across various domains, including speech recognition, healthcare, 
autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, predictive analytics, and more. However, the complexity and 
dynamic nature of real -world problems present challenges in designing effective deep learning models. 
Consequently, several deep  learning models have been developed to address different problems and 
applications. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of various deep learning models, 
including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN),  Temporal 
Convolutional Networks (TCN),  Transformer, Kolmogorov -Arnold networks (KAN), Generative 
Models, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Deep Transfer Learning. We examine the structure, 
applications, benefits, and limitations of each model. Furthermore, we perform an analysis using three 
publicly available datasets: IMDB, ARAS, and Fruit -360. We compared the performance of six renowned 
deep learning models: CNN, RNN, Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Gated 
Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional GRU alongside two newer models, TCN and Transformer, using 
the IMDB and ARAS datasets. Additionally, we evaluated the performance of eight CNN -based models, 
including VGG  (Visual Geometry Group ), Inception,  ResNet  (Residual Network ), InceptionResNet, 
Xception  (Extreme Inception ), MobileNet, DenseNet  (Dense Convolutional Network ), and NASNet  
(Neural Architecture Search Network ), for image classification tasks using the Fruit -360 dataset.

In recent years, deep learning (DL) techniques, a subset of machine learning (ML), have 
outperformed traditional ML approaches across numerous tasks, driven by several critical 
advancements  [3]. The proliferation of large datasets has been pivotal in enabling models to learn 
intricate patterns and relationships, thereby significantly enhancing their performance [4]. 
Concurrently, advancements in hardware acceleration technologies, notably Graphics Processing 
Units (GPUs) and Field -Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) [5] have markedly reduced model 
training times by facilitating rapid computations and parallel processing capabilities. These 
advancements have substantially accelerated the training process. Moreover, enhancements in 
algorithmic techniques for optimization a nd training have further augmented the speed and 
efficiency of deep learning models, leading to quicker convergence and superior generalization 
capabilities [4]. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide 
range of applications, including computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and 
speech recognition. These applications underscore the transformative impact of DL in  various 
domains, where it continues to set new performance benchmarks [6, 7]. 
Deep learning models draw inspiration from the structure and functionality of the human 
nervous system and brain. These models employ input, hidden, and output layers to organize 
processing units. Within each layer, the nodes or units are interconnected wi th those in the layer 
below, and each connection is assigned a weight value. The units sum the inputs after multiplying 
them by their corresponding weights [8]. Fig. 1  illustrates the relationship between AI, ML, and 
DL, highlighting that machine learning and deep learning are subfields of artificial intelligence.  
The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive overview of various deep learning 
models and compare their performance across different applications. In Section 2 , we introduce a 
fundamental definition of deep learning. Section 3  covers supervised deep learning models, 
including Multi -Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent 
Neural Networks (RNN), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and Kolmogorov -Arnold 
Networks (KAN). Section 4  reviews generative models such as Autoencoders, Generative 
Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs). Section 5  presents a 
comprehensive survey of the Transformer architecture. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is 
discussed in Section 6 , while Section 7  addresses Deep Transfer Learning (DTL). The principles 
of hybrid deep learning are explored in Section 8 , followed by a discussion of deep learning 
applications in Section 9 . Section 10  surveys the challenges in deep learning and potential 
alternative solutions. In Section 11 , we conduct experiments and analyze the performance of 
different deep learning models using three datasets. Research directions and future aspects are 
covered in Section 12 . Finally, Section 13  concludes the paper.

2 Deep Learning  
Deep learning (DL) involves the process of learning hierarchical representations of data by 
utilizing architectures with multiple hidden layers. With the advancement of high -performance 
computing facilities, deep learning techniques using deep neural netwo rks have gained increasing 
popularity [9]. In a deep learning algorithm, data is passed through multiple layers, with each layer 
progressively extracting features and transmitting information to the subsequent layer. The initial 
layers extract low -level characteristics, which are then combined by  later layers to form a 
comprehensive representation [6]. 
In traditional machine learning techniques, the classification task typically involves a 
sequential process that includes pre -processing, feature extraction, meticulous feature selection, 
learning, and classification. The effectiveness of machine learning methods heavily relies on 
accurate feature selection, as biased feature selection can lead to incorrect class classification. In 
contrast, deep learning models enable simultaneous learning and classification, eliminating the 
need for separate steps. This c apability makes deep learning particularly advantageous for 
automating feature learning across diverse tasks [10]. Fig. 2  visually illustrates the distinction 
between deep learning and traditional machine learning in terms of feature extraction and learning.  
In the era of deep learning, a wide array of methods and architec tures have been developed. 
These models can be broadly categorized into two main groups: discriminative (supervised) and 
generative (unsupervised) approaches. Among the discriminative models, two prominent groups 
are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Additionally, 
generative approaches encompass various models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
and Auto -Encoders (AEs) [11]. In the following sections, we provide a comprehensive survey of 
different types of deep learning models.

learning in terms of feature extraction and learning  [10]. 
3 Supervised  Deep Learning Models  
In supervised learning and classification tasks, this family of deep learning algorithms is used 
to perform discriminative functions. These supervised deep architectures typically model the 
posterior distributions of classes based on observable data, enabl ing effective pattern classification. 
Common supervised models include Multi -Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), 
Kolmogorov -Arnold Networks (KAN), and their va riations. A brief overview of these methods 
follows.  
3.1 Multi Layers Perceptron (MLP)   
The Multi -Layer Perceptron (MLP) model is a type of feedforward artificial neural network 
 
x                                                                      JAI, 202 4 
(ANN) that serves as a foundation architecture for deep learning or deep neural networks (DNNs) 
[11]. It operates as a supervised learning approach. The MLP consists of three layers: the input 
layer, the output layer, and one or more hidden layers [12]. It is a fully connected network, meaning 
each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the subsequent layer.  
In an MLP, the input layer receives the input data and performs feature normalization. The 
hidden layers, which can vary in number, process the input signals. The output layer makes 
decisions or predictions based on the processed information [13]. Fig. 3 (a) depicts a single -neuron 
perceptron model, where the activation function φ ( Eq. (1) ) is a non -linear function used to map 
the summation function  (𝑥𝑤+𝑏) to the output value  𝑦. 
𝑦 = 𝜑(𝑥𝑤+𝑏)                                                                                                                                            (1) 
In Eq. (1) , the terms 𝑥,𝑤,𝑏, and 𝑦 represent the input vector, weighting vector, bias, and 
output value, respectively [14]. Fig. 3 (b) illustrates the structure of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) 
model.

3.2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)   
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a powerful class of deep learning models widely 
applied in various tasks, including object detection, speech recognition, computer vision, image 
classification, and bioinformatics [15]. They have also demonstrated success in time series 
prediction tasks [16]. CNNs are feedforward neural networks that leverage convolutional structures 
to extract features from data [17]. CNN has a two -stage architecture that combines a classifier and 
a feature extractor to provide automatic feature extraction and end -to-end training with the least 
amount of pre -processing necessary [18]. Unlike traditional methods, CNNs automatically learn 
and recognize features from the data without the need for manual feature extraction by humans 
[19]. The design of CNNs is inspired by visual perception [17]. The major components of CNNs 
include the convolutional layer, pooling layer, fully connected layer, and activation function [20, 
21]. Fig. 4 presents the pipeline of the convolutional neural network , highlighting how each layer 
contributes to the efficient processing and successful progression of input data through the network .

Figure 5.  Schematic diagram of the convolution process [22]. 
 
Convolutional Layer:  The convolutional layer is a pivotal component of CNN. Through 
multiple convolutional layers, the convolution operation extracts distinct features from the input. 
In image classification, lower layers tend to capture basic features such as texture, lines,  and edges, 
while higher layers extract more abstract features. The convolutional layer comprises learnable 
convolution kernels, which are weight matrices typically of equal length, width, and an odd number 
(e.g., 3x3, 5x5, or 7x7). The se kernels are convolved with the input feature maps, sliding over the 
regions of the feature map and executing convolution operations [22]. Fig. 5 illustrates the 
schematic diagram of the convolution process.  
Pooling Layer:  Typically  following the convolutional layer, the pooling layer reduces the 
number of connections in the network by performing down -sampling and dimensionality reduction 
on the input data [23]. Its primary purpose is to alleviate the computational burden and address 
overfitting issues  [24]. Moreover, the pooling layer enables CNN to recognize objects even when 
their shapes are distorted or viewed from different angles, by incorporating various dimensions of 
an image through pooling [25]. The pooling operation produces output feature maps that are more 
robust against distortion and errors in individual neurons [26]. There are various pooling methods, 
including Max Pooling, Average Pooling, Spatial Pyramid Pooling, Mixed Pooling, Multi -Scale 
Order -Less, and Stochastic Pooling  [27-30]. Fig. 6  depicts an example of Max Pooling, where a 
window slides across the input, and the contents of the window are processed by a pooling function 
[31].

Fully Connected (FC) Layer:  The FC layer is typically located at the end of a CNN 
architecture. In this layer, every neuron is connected to all neurons in the preceding layer, adhering 
to the principles of a conventional multi -layer perceptron neural network. The FC layer receives 
input from the last pooling or convolutional layer, which is a vector created by flattening the feature 
maps. The FC layer serves as the classifier in the CNN, enabling the network to make predictions 
[10]. 
Activation Functions : Activation functions are fundamental components in convolutional 
neural networks (CNNs), indispensable for introducing non -linearity into the network. This non -
linearity is crucial for CNN’s  ability to model complex patterns and relationships within the data, 
allowing it to perform tasks beyond simple linear classification or regression. Without non -linear 
activation functions, a CNN would be limited to linear operations, significantly constr aining its 
capacity to accurately represent the intricate, non -linear behaviors typical of many real -world 
phenomena [32].  
Fig. 7  typically illustrates how these activation functions modulate input signals to produce 
output, highlighting the non -linear transformations applied to the input data across different regions 
of the function curve. In this figure, 𝑥𝑖 represents the input feature, while 𝑤𝑖𝑗 denotes the weight 
associated with the connection between the input feature 𝑥𝑖 and neuron 𝑗. The figure shows that 
neuron 𝑗 receives 𝑛 features simultaneously. The output from neuron 𝑗 is labeled by 𝑦𝑗, and its 
internal state, or bias, is indicated by 𝑏𝑗. The activation function, depicted as 𝑓(.), could be any 
one of several types such as the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), hyperbolic tangent (Tanh), Sigmoid 
function, or others [33, 34].  
These various activation functions are shown in Fig. 8 , with emphasis on their distinct 
characteristics and profiles. These activation functions are essential for convolutional neural 
networks  (CNNs) to be more effective in a variety of applications by allowing them to recognize 
intricate patterns and provide accurate predictions.  Sigmoid and Tanh functions are frequently 
referred to as saturating nonlinearities due to the way they act when inputs are very large or small. 
As per the reference, the Sigmoid function approaches values of 0 or 1, whereas the Tanh function 
leans towards -1 or 1 [17]. Different alternative nonlinearities have been suggested for reducing 
problems associated with these saturating effects, including Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)  [35], 
Leaky ReLU [36], Parametric Rectified Linear Units (PReLU) [37], Randomized Leaky ReLU 
(RReLU) [38], S-shaped ReLU (SReLU) [39], and Exponential Linear Units (ELUs) [40], Gaussian 
Error Linear Units (GELUs)  [41].

ReLU  (Rectified Linear Unit) is one of the most often used activation functions in modern 
CNNs because of how well it solves the vanishing gradient issue during training. The definition of 
ReLU in mathematics is as Eq. (2) , where  the input to the neuron is represented by  𝑥 [34]. 
𝑓(𝑥)=max(0,𝑥)={𝑥𝑖,   𝑖𝑓 𝑥𝑖≥0 
0,   𝑖𝑓 𝑥𝑖<0                                                                                                      (2)  
This feature helps CNN learn complicated features more efficiently by effectively "turning 
off" any negative input values while maintaining positive values. It also keeps neurons from being 
saturated during training.  
As an alternative, the definition of the Sigmoid function is represent ed by Eq. (3) , where 𝑥 
stands for the input of the neuron.  
𝑓(𝑥)=1
𝑒−𝑥                                                                                                                                                                  (3)   
Although the sigmoid distinctive S -shape and capacity to condense real numbers into a range 
between 0 and 1 make it useful for binary classification, its propensity to saturate can hinder 
training by causing the vanishing gradient problem in deep neural networks.  
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are extensively used in various fields, including 
natural language processing, image segmentation, image analysis, video analysis, and more. 
Several CNN variations have been developed, such as  AlexNet  [42], VGG  (Visual Geometry Group ) 
[43], Inception  [44, 45], ResNet  (Residual Networks ) [46, 47], WideResNet [48], FractalNet [49], 
SqueezeNet [50], InceptionResNet [51], Xception  (Extreme Inception)  [52], MobileNet  [53, 54], 
DenseNet  (Dense Convolutional Network)  [55], SENet  (Squeeze -and-Excitation  Network)  [56], 
Efficientnet [57, 58] among others. These variants are applied in different application areas based 
on their learning capabilities and performance.

3.3 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)   
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of deep learning models that possess internal 
memory, enabling them to capture sequential dependencies. Unlike traditional neural networks that 
treat inputs as independent entities, RNNs consider the temporal or der of inputs, making them 
suitable for tasks involving sequential information [59]. By employing a loop, RNNs apply the 
same operation to each element in a series, with the current computation depending on both the 
current input and the previous computations [60]. 
The ability of RNNs to utilize contextual information is particularly valuable in tasks such as 
natural language processing, video classification, and speech recognition. For example, in language 
modeling, understanding the preceding words in a sentence is  crucial for predicting the next word. 
RNNs excel at capturing such dependencies due to their recurrent nature [61-63]. 
However, a limitation of simple RNN is their short -term memory, which restricts their ability 
to retain information over long sequences [64]. To overcome this, more advanced RNN variants 
have been developed, including Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) [65], bidirectional LSTM [66], 
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [67], bidirectional GRU [68], Bayesian RNN [69], and others.  
 
 
Figure 9.  Simple RNN internal operation  [70]. 
 
Fig. 9  depicts a simple recurrent neural network, where the internal memory ( ℎ𝑡) is computed 
using Eq. (4)  [70]: 
ℎ𝑡= 𝑔(𝑊𝑥𝑡+ 𝑈ℎ𝑡+ 𝑏)                                                                                                                                            (4) 
In this equation, 𝑔() represents the activation function (typically Tanh ), 𝑈 and 𝑊 are 
adjustable weight matrices for the hidden state (ℎ), 𝑏 is the bias, and  𝑥 denotes the input vector.  
RNNs have proven to be powerful models for processing sequential data, leveraging their 
ability to capture dependencies over time. The various  types of RNN models, such as LSTM, 
bidirectional LSTM, GRU, and bidirectional GRU, have been developed to address specific 
challenges in different applications.  
3.3.1 Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM)  
Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) is an advanced variant of Recurrent Neural Networks 
(RNN) that addresses the issue of capturing long -term dependencies. LSTM was initially 
introduced by [65] in 1997 and further improved by [71] in 2013, gaining significant popularity in 
the deep learning community. Compared to standard RNN, LSTM models have proven to be more 
effective at retaining and utilizing information over longer sequences .  
In an LSTM network, the current input at a specific time step and the output from the previous 
time step are fed into the LSTM unit, which then generates an output that is passed to the next time 
step. The final hidden layer of the last time step, sometime s along with all hidden layers, is 
commonly employed for classification purposes [72]. The overall architecture of an LSTM network 
is depicted in Fig. 10 (a) . LSTM consists of three gates: input gate, forget gate, and output gate. 
Each gate performs a specific function in controlling the flow of information.  The input gate decides 
how to update the internal state based on the current input and the previous internal state. The forget 
gate determines how much of the previous internal state should be forgotten. Finally, the output 
gate regulates the influence of the internal state on the system [60, 73].

Fig. 10 (b)  illustrates the update mechanism within the inner structure of an LSTM.  The update 
for the LSTM unit is expressed by Eq. (5) : 
{      ℎ(𝑡)=𝑔𝑜(𝑡)𝑓ℎ(𝑠(𝑡))                                                                                                                                           
𝑠(𝑡−1)=𝑔𝑓(𝑡)𝑠(𝑡−1)+𝑔𝑖(𝑡)𝑓𝑠(𝑤ℎ(𝑡−1))+𝑢𝑋(𝑡)+𝑏                                                                                
𝑔𝑖(𝑡)= 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑑 (𝑤𝑖ℎ(𝑡−1)+𝑢𝑖𝑋(𝑡)+𝑏𝑖)                                                                                          (5)
𝑔𝑓(𝑡)=𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑑 (𝑤𝑓ℎ(𝑡−1)+𝑢𝑓𝑋(𝑡)+𝑏𝑓)                                                                                                
𝑔𝑜(𝑡)= 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑖𝑑 (𝑤𝑜ℎ(𝑡−1)+𝑢𝑜𝑋(𝑡)+𝑏𝑜)                                                                                                
where 𝑓ℎ and 𝑓𝑠 represent the activation functions of the system state and internal state, 
typically utilizing the hyperbolic tangent function. The gating operation, denoted as g, is a 
feedforward neural network with a sigmoid activation function, ensuring output values within the 
range of [0, 1], which are interpreted as a set of weights. The subscripts 𝑖,𝑜, and 𝑓 correspond to 
the input gate, output gate, and forget gate, respectively.  
While standard LSTM has demonstrated promising performance in various tasks, it may 
struggle to comprehend input structures that are more complex than a sequential format. To address 
this limitation, a tree -structured LSTM network, known as S -LSTM, was pro posed by [74]. S-
LSTM consists of memory blocks comprising an input gate, two forget gates, a cell gate, and an 
output gate. While S -LSTM exhibits superior performance in challenging sequential modeling 
problems, it comes with higher computational complexity compared t o standard LSTM [75]. 
3.3.2 Bidirectional LSTM  
Bidirectional Long Short -Term Memory (Bi -LSTM) is an extension of the LSTM architecture 
that addresses the limitation of standard LSTM models by considering both past and future context 
in sequence modeling tasks. While traditional LSTM models process inpu t data only in the forward 
direction, Bi -LSTM overcomes this limitation by training the model in two directions: forward and 
backward [76, 77]. 
A Bi -LSTM consists of two parallel LSTM layers: one processes the input sequence in the 
forward direction, while the other processes it in the backward direction. The forward LSTM layer 
reads the input data from left to right, as indicated by the green arr ow in Fig. 11 . Simultaneously, 
the backward LSTM layer reads the input data from right to left, as represented by the red arrow 
[78]. This bidirectional processing enables the model to capture information from both past and 
future context s, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of temporal dependencies within 
the sequence.

Figure 11.  The architecture of a Bidirectional LSTM model  [76]. 
 
During the training phase, the forward and backward LSTM layers independently extract 
features and update their internal states based on the input sequence. The output of each LSTM 
layer at each time step is a prediction score. These prediction scores are then combined using a 
weighted sum to generate the final output result [78]. By incorporating information from both 
directions, Bi -LSTM models can capture a broader context and improve the model's ability to 
model temporal dependencies in sequential data.  
Bi-LSTM has been widely applied in various sequence modeling tasks such as natural 
language processing, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis. It has shown promising results in 
capturing complex patterns and dependencies in sequential data, making it a popular choice for 
tasks that require an understanding of both past and future context.  
3.3.3 Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)  
The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is another variant of the RNN architecture that addresses the 
short -term memory issue and offers a simpler structure compared to LSTM [59]. GRU combines 
the input gate and forget gate of LSTM into a single update gate, resulting in a more streamlined 
design. Unlike LSTM, GRU does not include a separate cell state.  A GRU unit consists of three 
main components: an update gate, a reset gate, and the current memory content. These gates enable 
the GRU to selectively update and utilize information from previous time steps, allowing it to 
capture long -term dependencies in sequences [79]. Fig. 12  illustrates the structure of a GRU unit 
[80]. 
The update gate ( Eq. (6) ) determines how much of the past information should be retained and 
combined with the current input at a specific time step. It is computed based on the concatenation 
of the previous hidden state ℎ𝑡−1 and the current input 𝑥𝑡, followed by a linear transformation 
and a sigmoid activation function.  
𝑧𝑡=𝜎(𝑊𝑧[ℎ𝑡−1,𝑥𝑡]+𝑏𝑧)                                                                                                                         (6)  
The reset gate ( Eq. (7) ) decides how much of the past information should be forgotten. It is 
computed in a similar manner to the update gate using the concatenation of the previous hidden 
state and the current input.  
𝑟𝑡=𝜎(𝑊𝑟[ℎ𝑡−1,𝑥𝑡]+𝑏𝑟)                                                                                                                          (7)  
The current memory content ( Eq. (8) ) is calculated based on the reset gate and the 
concatenation of the transformed previous hidden state and the current input. The result is passed 
through a hyperbolic tangent activation function to produce the candidate activation.  
ℎ̃𝑡=𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑊ℎ[𝑟𝑡ℎ𝑡−1,𝑥𝑡])                                                                                                                        (8)  
 
 
JAI, 202 4                                                                             x 
 
Figure 12.  The structure of a GRU unit [80]. 
 
Finally, the final memory state ℎ𝑡 is determined by a combination of the previous hidden 
state and the candidate activation ( Eq. (9) ). The update gate determines the balance between the 
previous hidden state and the candidate activation. Additionally, an output gate 𝑜𝑡 can be 
introduced to control the information flow from the current memory content to the output ( Eq. (10) ). 
The output gate is computed using the current memory state ℎ𝑡 and is typically followed by an 
activation function, such as the sigmoid function.  
ℎ𝑡=(1−𝑧𝑡)ℎ𝑡−1+𝑧𝑡ℎ̃𝑡                                                                                                                            (9) 
𝑜𝑡=𝜎𝑜(𝑊𝑜ℎ𝑡+𝑏𝑜)                                                                                                                                   (10) 
where the weight matrix of the output layer is 𝑊𝑜 and the bias vector of the output layer is 
𝑏𝑜. 
GRU offers a simpler alternative to LSTM with fewer tensor operations, allowing for faster 
training. However, the choice between GRU and LSTM depends on the specific use case and 
problem at hand. Both architectures have their advantages and disadvantages, and their 
performance may vary depending on the nature of the task [59]. 
3.3.4 Bidirectional GRU  
The Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi -GRU) [81] improves upon the conventional GRU 
architecture  through the integration of contexts from the past and future in sequential modeling 
tasks.  In contrast to the conventional GRU, which exclusively processes input sequences forward, 
the Bi -GRU manages sequences in both forward and backward directions . In order to do this, two 
parallel GRU layers are used, one of which processes the input data forward and the other in reverse  
[82]. Fig. 13  shows the Bi -GRU's structural layout.  
 
 
Figure 1 3. The structure of a Bi -GRU model  [83].

3.4 Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)  
Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) represent a significant advancement in neural 
network architectures, specifically tailored for handling sequential data, particularly time series. 
Originating as an extension of the one -dimensional Convolutional Neural  Network (CNN), TCN 
was first introduced by [84] in 2017 for the task of action segmentation in video data, and its 
application was further generalized to other types of sequential data by [85] in 2018. TCN retains 
the powerful feature extraction capabilities inherent to CNN while being highly efficient in 
processing and analyzing time series data.  
The purpose of training TCN  is to forecast the next 𝑙 values of the input time series. Assume 
that we have a sequence of inputs 𝑥0,𝑥1,….,𝑥𝑙. We would like to predict, at each time step, some 
corresponding output 𝑦0,𝑦1,….,𝑦𝑙, whose values are equal to the inputs shifted forward 𝑙 time 
steps. The primary limitation is that it can only use the inputs that have already been observed: 
𝑥0,𝑥1,….,𝑥𝑡, when forecasting the output 𝑦𝑡 for a given time step 𝑡 [86]. TCN is characterized 
by two fundamental properties: (1) The convolutions within the network are causal, ensuring that 
the output at any given time step depends solely on the current and past inputs, without any 
influence from future inputs. (2) Similar to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), TCN can process 
sequences of arbitrary length and produce output sequences of identical length. The three primary 
components of a typical TCN are residual connections, dilated convolution, and causal convolution 
[85, 87, 88]. Fig. 14  illustrates the schematic architecture of a TCN model.   
 
 
Figure 14.  Schematic diagram of the TCN model architecture  [89]. 
Causal Convolution :  
The TCN  architecture is built upon two foundational principles. To adhere to the first principle, 
the initial layer of a TCN is a one -dimensional fully convolutional network, wherein each hidden 
layer maintains the same length as the input layer, achieved through  zero-padding. This padding 
ensures that each successive layer remains the same length as the preceding one. To satisfy the 
second principle, TCN employs causal convolutions. A causal convolution is a specialized one -
dimensional convolutional network where  only elements from time 𝑡 and earlier are convolved to 
produce the output at time 𝑡. Fig. 15  demonstrates the structure of a causal convolutional network.  
Dilated Convolution :  
TCN aims to effectively capture long -range dependencies in sequential data. A simple causal 
convolution can only consider a history that scales linearly with the depth of the network. This 
limitation would necessitate the use of large filters or an excepti onally deep network structure, 
which could hinder performance, particularly for tasks requiring a longer history.  
 
JAI, 202 4                                                                             x 
 
Figure 15.  The structure of the causal convolutional network [87]. 
 
The depth of the network could lead to issues such as vanishing gradients, ultimately degrading 
network performance or causing it to plateau. To address these challenges, TCN employs dilated 
convolutions [90], which exponentially expand the receptive field, allowing the network to process 
large time series efficiently without a proportional increase in computational complexity. The 
architecture of a dilated convolutional network is depicted in  Fig. 16 . 
By inserting gaps between the weights of the convolutional kernel, dilated convolutions 
effectively increase the network's receptive field while maintaining computational efficiency. The 
mathematical formulation of a dilated convolution is given by Eq. (1 1). 
𝐹(𝑠)=(𝑥∗𝑑𝑓)(𝑠)=∑𝑓(𝑖)∙𝑥𝑠−𝑑∙𝑖                                                                                                  (11)𝑘−1
𝑖=0 
where 𝑑 is the dilation rate, 𝑘 is the size of the filter, and 𝑠−𝑑∙𝑖 accounts for the 
direction of the past. Dilation is the same as adding a fixed step in between each pair of neighboring 
filter taps. When 𝑑 = 1, dilated convolution becomes a regular convolution. As 𝑑 increases, the 
output at the higher layers reflects a broader range of inputs, improving performance on long -range 
dependencies in time series.  
Residual Connections :  
To construct a more expressive TCN model, it is essential to use small filter sizes and stack 
multiple layers. However, stacking dilated and causal convolutional layers increases the depth of 
the network, potentially leading to problems such as gradient de cay or vanishing gradients during 
training. To mitigate these issues, TCN incorporates residual connections into the output layer. 
Residual connections facilitate the flow of data across layers by adding a shortcut path, allowing 
the network to learn resid ual functions, which are modifications to the identity mapping, rather than 
learning a full transformation. This approach has been shown to be highly effective in very deep 
networks.  
 
Figure 16.  Dilated convolutional structure [87]. 
 
x                                                                      JAI, 202 4 
A residual block [46] has a branch that lead to a set of transformations F, whose outputs are 
appended to block's input x, as shown in  Eq. (1 2). 
𝑜=𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  (𝑥+𝐹(𝑥))                                                                                                                     (12) 
This method enables the network to focus on learning residual functions rather than the entire 
mapping. The TCN residual block typically consists of two layers of dilated causal convolutions 
followed by a non -linear activation function, such as Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). The 
convolutional filters within the TCN are normalized using weight normalization [91], and dropout 
[92] is applied to each dilated convolution layer for regularization, where an entire channel is zeroed 
out at each training step. In contrast to a conventional ResNet, where the input is directly added to 
the output of the residual function, TCN adjusts for d iffering input -output widths by performing an 
additional 1 ×1 convolution to ensure that the element -wise addition ⊕ operates on tensors of 
matching dimensions.  
3.6 Kolmogorov -Arnold Network ( KAN ) 
Kolmogorov -Arnold Networks (KANs) represent a promising alternative to traditional Multi -
Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by leveraging the Kolmogorov -Arnold theorem, a sophisticated 
mathematical framework that enhances the capacity of neural networks to process c omplex data 
structures. KANs were first introduced in 2024 by [93], with the goal of incorporating advanced 
mathematical theories into deep learning architectures to improve their performance on intricate 
tasks. While MLPs are inspired by the universal approximation theorem, KANs are motivated by 
the Kolmogorov -Arnold re presentation theorem [94], which states that any multivariate continuous 
function 𝑓 over a bounded domain can be expressed as a finite composition of simpler one -
dimensional continuous functions:  
𝑓(𝑥1,….,𝑥𝑛)=∑Φ𝑞2𝑛+1
𝑞=1(∑𝜙𝑞,𝑝(𝑥𝑝)𝑛
𝑝=1)                                                                                            (13) 
where 𝜙𝑞,𝑝 is a mapping [0,1] → ℝ and Φ𝑞 is a mapping ℝ → ℝ.  
KAN maintain a fully connected structure like MLP, but with a key distinction: while MLP 
assign fixed activation functions to nodes (neurons), KAN assign learnable activation functions to 
edges (weights). Consequently, KAN do not employ traditional linear weight matrices; instead, 
each weight paramet er is replaced by a learnable one -dimensional function parameterized as a 
spline. Unlike MLP, which apply non -linear activation functions at each node, KAN nodes only 
sum the incoming data, relying on the rich, learnable spline functions to introduce non -linearity. 
Although this approach might initially seem computationally expensive, KAN often result in 
significantly smaller computation graphs compared to MLP. Fig. 1 7 illustrates the structure of a 
KAN.

JAI, 202 4                                                                             x 
The Kolmogorov -Arnold Network (KAN) can be expressed specifically as follows:  
𝐾𝐴𝑁(𝑥) = (Φ𝐿−1 ◦Φ𝐿−2 ◦ · · · ◦ Φ1◦ Φ1)(𝑥)                                (14)  
The transformation of each layer,  Φ𝑙 , operates on the input 𝑥𝑙 to generate 𝑥𝑙+1, the input 
for the following layer, as follows:   
𝑥𝑙+1=Φ𝑙(𝑥𝑙)=   
(  𝜙𝑙,1,1(∙)𝜙𝑙,1,2(∙)
𝜙𝑙,2,1(∙)𝜙𝑙,2,2(∙)…𝜙𝑙,1,𝑛𝑙(∙)
…𝜙𝑙,2,𝑛𝑙(∙)

…𝜙𝑙,𝑛𝑙+1,𝑛𝑙(∙))   𝑥𝑙                                            (15) 
Where each activation function ∅𝑙,𝑗,𝑖 is a spline,  offering a rich, flexible response surface to 
inputs from the model:  
𝑠𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑥)=∑𝑐𝑖𝐵𝑖(𝑥),     𝑐𝑖 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒  𝑐𝑜𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠                                                            (16)
𝑖 
Several variants of KANs have emerged to tackle specific challenges in various applications:  
➢ Convolutional KAN (CKAN) [95]: CKAN is a pioneering alternative to standard CNN, which 
have significantly advanced the field of computer vision. Convolutional KAN integrate the 
non-linear activation functions of KAN into the convolutional layers, leading to a substantial 
reduction in the number of parameters and offering a novel approach to optimizing neural 
network architectures.  
➢ Temporal KAN  (TKAN)  [96]: Temporal Kolmogorov -Arnold Networks  combines the 
principles of KAN and Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) networks to create an advanced 
architecture for time series analysis. Comprising layers of Recurrent Kolmogorov -Arnold 
Networks (RKANs) with embedded memory management, TKAN excels in multi -step time 
series forecasting . The TKAN architecture offers tremendous promise for improvement in 
domains needing one -step-ahead forecasting by solving the shortcomings of existing models 
in handling complicated sequential patterns [97, 98]. 
➢ Multivariate Time Series KAN ( MT-KAN ) [99]: MT-KAN is specifically designed to handle 
multivariate time series data. The primary objective of MT -KAN is to enhance forecasting 
accuracy by modeling the intricate interactions between multiple variables. MT -KAN utilizes 
spline -parametrized univariate functions t o capture temporal relationships while incorporating 
methods to model cross -variable interactions.  
➢ Fractional KAN (fKAN) [100]: fKAN is an enhancement of the KAN architecture that 
integrates the unique properties of fractional -orthogonal Jacobi functions into the network's 
basis functions.  This method guarantees effective learning and improved accuracy by utilizing 
the special mathematical characteristics of fractional Jacobi functions, such as straightforward 
derivative equations, non -polynomial behavior, and activity for positive and negat ive input 
values.  
➢ Wavelet KAN (Wav -KAN ) [101]: The purpose of this innovative neural network design is to 
improve interpretability and performance by incorporating wavelet functions into the 
Kolmogorov -Arnold Networks (KAN) framework. Wav -KAN is an excellent way to capture 
complicated data patterns by utilizing wavelets' multiresolution analysis capabilities. It offers 
a reliable solution to the drawbacks of both recently suggested KANs and classic multilayer 
perceptrons (MLPs).  
➢ Graph  KAN [102]: This innovative model applies KAN principles to graph -structured data, 
replacing the MLP and activation functions typically used in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) 
with KAN. This substitution enables more effective feature extraction from graph -like data 
structures.

4 Generative (Uns upervised ) Deep Learning Models  
Supervised machine learning is widely used in artificial intelligence (AI), while unsupervised 
learning remains an active area of research with numerous unresolved questions. However, recent 
advancements in deep learning and generative modeling have inject ed new possibilities into 
unsupervised learning. A rapidly evolving domain within computer vision research is generative 
models (GMs). These models leverage training data originating from an unknown data -generating 
distribution to produce novel samples tha t adhere to the same distribution. The ultimate goal of 
generative models is to generate data samples that closely resemble real data distribution [103]. 
Various generative models have been developed and applied in different contexts, such as 
Auto -Encoder [104], Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)  [105], Restricted Boltzmann 
Machine (RBM) [106], and Deep Belief Network (DBN) [107]. 
4.1 Autoencoder  
The concept of an autoencoder originated as a neural network designed to reconstruct its input 
data. Its fundamental objective is to learn a meaningful representation of the data in an unsupervised 
manner, which can have various applications, including clu stering [104]. 
An autoencoder is a neural network that aims to replicate its input at its output. It consists of 
an internal hidden layer that defines a code representing the input data. The autoencoder network 
is comprised of two main components: an encoder function, de noted as 𝑧 = 𝑓(𝑥), and a decoder 
function that generates a reconstruction, denoted as 𝑟 = 𝑔(𝑧) [108]. The function 𝑓(𝑥) 
transforms a data point 𝑥 from the data space to the feature space, while the function 𝑔(𝑧) 
transforms 𝑧 from the feature space back to the data space to reconstruct the original data point 
𝑥. In modern autoencoders, these functions 𝑧 = 𝑓(𝑥) and 𝑟 = 𝑔(𝑧) are considered as 
stochastic functions, represented as 𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟  (𝑧|𝑥) and 𝑝𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟  (𝑟|𝑧), respectively, where 𝑟 
denotes the reconstruction of 𝑥 [109]. Fig. 18 illustrates an autoencoder model.  
Autoencoder models find utility in various unsupervised learning tasks, such as generative 
modeling [110], dimensionality reduction [111], feature extraction [112], anomaly or outlier 
detection [113], and denoising [114]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 8. The structure of autoencoders.   
 
In general, autoencoder models can be categorized into two major groups: Regularized 
Autoencoders, which are valuable for learning representations for subsequent classification tasks, 
and Variational Autoencoders [115], which can function as generative models. Examples of 
regularized autoencoder models include Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) [116], Contractive 
Autoencoder (CAE) [117], and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) [118]. 
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model that employs probabilistic distributions, 
such as the mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution, for data generation [104]. VAE provide 
a principled framework for learning deep latent -variable models and their associated inference 
models. The VAE consists of two coupled but independently parameterized models: the encoder 
or recognition model and the decoder or generative mode l. During "expectation maximization"

learning iterations, the generative model receives an approximate posterior estimation of its latent 
random variables from the recognition model, which it uses to update its parameters. Conversely, 
the generative model acts as a scaffold for the recognitio n model, enabling it to learn meaningful 
representations of the data, such as potential class labels. In terms of Bayes' rule, the recognition 
model is roughly the inverse of the generative model [119]. 
4.2 Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)  
A notable neural network architecture for generative modeling, capable of producing realistic 
and novel samples on demand, is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), initially proposed 
by Ian Goodfellow  in 2014 [105]. A GAN consists of two key components: a generative model and 
a discriminative model. The generative model aims to generate data that resemble real ones, while 
the discriminative model aims to differentiate between real and synthetic data. Both models are 
typically implemented using multilayer perceptrons [120]. Fig. 19 depicts the framework of a GAN, 
where a two -player adversarial game is played between a generator (G) and a discriminator (D). 
The generator's updating gradients are determined by the discriminator through an adaptive 
objective [121]. 
 
 
Figure 19. The framework of a G AN.   
 
As previously mentioned, GANs operate based on principles derived from neural networks, 
utilizing a training set as input to generate new data that resembles the training set. In the case of 
GANs trained on image data, they can generate new images exhibiti ng human -like characteristics.  
The following outlines the step -by-step operation of a GAN [122]: 
1. The generator, created by a discriminative network, generates content based on the real data 
distribution.  
2. The system undergoes training to increase the discriminator's ability to distinguish between 
synthesized and real candidates, allowing the generator to better fool the discriminator.  
3. The discriminator initially trains using a dataset as the training data.  
4. Training sample datasets are repeatedly presented until the desired accuracy is achieved.  
5. The generator is trained to process random input and generate candidates that deceive the 
discriminator.  
 
x                                                                      JAI, 202 4 
6. Backpropagation is employed to update both the discriminator and the generator, with the 
former improving its ability to identify real images and the latter becoming more adept at 
producing realistic synthetic images.  
7. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used as discriminators, while 
deconvolutional neural networks are utilized as generative networks.  
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have introduced numerous applications across 
various domains, including image blending [123], 3D object generation [124], face aging [125], 
medicine [126, 127], steganography [128], image manipulation [129], text transfer [130], language 
and speech synthesis [131], traffic control [132], and video generation [133]. 
Furthermore, several models have been developed based on the Generative Adversarial 
Network (GAN) framework to address specific tasks. These models include Laplacian GAN (Lap -
GAN) [134], Coupled GAN (Co -GAN) [120], Markovian GAN [135], Unrolled GAN [136], 
Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) [137], and Boundary Equilibrium GAN (BEGAN) [138], CycleGAN  
[139], DiscoGAN [140], Relativistic GAN [141], StyleGAN [142], Evolutionary GAN (E -GAN) 
[121], Bayesian Conditional GAN [143], Graph Embedding GAN (GE -GAN) [132].  
4.3 Deep Belief Network (DBN)  
The Deep Belief Network (DBN) is a type of deep generative model utilized primarily in 
unsupervised learning to uncover patterns within large datasets. Consisting of multiple layers of 
hidden units, DBNs are adept at identifying intricate patterns and extr acting features from data. 
Unlike discriminative models, DBNs exhibit a higher resistance to overfitting, making them well -
suited for feature extraction from unlabeled data [144].  
The stack of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), which operate in an unsupervised 
learning framework, is a fundamental part of DBN. Every RBM in a DBN is made up of a hidden 
layer that contains latent representations and a visible layer that represents o bservable data features  
[145]. RBMs are trained layer by layer: first, each RBM is trained independently, and then all of 
the RBMs are fine -tuned together as a whole within the DBN.  
During the forward pass, the activations represent the probability of an output given a weighted 
input. In the backward pass, the activations estimate the probability of inputs given the weighted 
outputs. Through iterative training of RBMs within a DBN, th ese processes converge to form joint 
probability distributions of activations and inputs, allowing the network to effectively capture the 
underlying data structure  [146, 147]. Fig. 20 illustrates the schematic structure of a Deep Belief 
Network (DBN).

5 Transformer Architecture  
The Transformer architecture was originally introduced by Vaswani et al. [148] in 2017 for 
machine translation and has since become a foundational model in deep learning, especially for 
natural language processing (NLP). The transformer functions as a self -attention encoder -decoder 
structure. The encoder consists of a stack of identical  layers , and each layer consists of two 
sublayers. A multi -head self -attention mechanism is the first layer, while the other layer is a 
position -wise fully connected feed -forward network. Also, A normalizing layer [149] and residual 
connections  [46] connect the multi -headed self -attention module's inputs and output. After that, a 
decoder uses the representation that the encoder produced to create an output sequence. A stack of 
identical layers makes up the decoder as well. The decoder adds a third sub -layer to each encoder 
layer in addition to the primary two, and this sub -layer handles multi -head attention over the 
encoder stack's output. Like the encoder, residual connections and a normalizing layer are used 
surrounding each of the sub -layers. The encoder and decoder's overall Transformer design is 
depicted in  Fig. 21, left and right halves respectively [150, 151].  
Traditional RNN -based Seq2Seq models could be replaced with attention layers. Using 
various projection matrices, the query, key, and value vectors in the self-attention layer are all 
produced from the same sequence [152]. RNN training takes a very long period because it is 
sequential and iterative. Transformer training, on the other hand, is parallel and enables all features 
to be learned concurrently, significantly improving computational efficiency and cutting down on 
the amount of time needed for model training [153]. 
Multi -Head Attention: In the Transformer model, a multi -headed self -attention mechanism 
is employed to enhance the model's ability to capture dependencies between elements in a sequence. 
The core principle of the attention mechanism is that every token in the sequence can aggre gate 
information from other tokens, allowing the model to understand contextual relationships more 
effectively. This is achieved by mapping a query, a set of key -value pairs, and an output (each 
represented as vectors) to form an atte ntion function. The output is computed as a weighted sum of 
the values, where the weights are determined by the compatibility function between the query and 
its corresponding key  [148].

Multi -head attention is equivalent to the blended of 𝑛 distinct scaled dot -product attention 
(self-attention). It can effectively process the three vectors Q, K, and V, in parallel to obtain the 
final result by combining and calculating. The formula is visible in Eq. ( 17). 
{𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑  (𝑄,𝐾,𝑉)=𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑎𝑡(ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑1,…,ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑2)𝑊𝑂
𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖=𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  (𝑄𝑊𝑖𝑄,𝐾𝑊𝑖𝐾,𝑉𝑊𝑖𝑉)                                                                 (17) 
Where the projections are parameter matrices 𝑊𝑖𝑄 ∈ ℝ𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙×𝑑𝑘,𝑊𝑖𝐾 ∈ ℝ𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙×𝑑𝑘,𝑊𝑖𝑉 ∈
 ℝ𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙×𝑑𝑉,𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑊𝑂 ∈ ℝℎ𝑑𝑣×𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 . 
The main component of the transformer, scaled dot -product attention (self-attention), uses the 
weight of each sensor event in the input vector, which is represented by  
𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  (𝑄,𝐾,𝑉)=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑄𝐾𝑇
√𝑑𝑘)𝑉                                                                                         (18) 
The initial step in scaled dot -product attention is to convert the input data into an embedding 
vector and the three vectors of query vector (Q), key vector (K), and value vector (V) are then 
extracted from the embedding vectors. Next, a score is determined for every vector: score is equal 
to 𝑄· 𝐾. Score normalization (dividing by √𝑑𝑘) is used for gradient stability.  Next, the score is 
processed using the softmax activation function. The weighted score 𝑣 for every input vector is 
obtained by taking the softmax dot product value 𝑣. The final result is produced after summing. 
Scaled dot -product attention and multi -head attention are displayed in Fig. 22 [154].  
Position -wise Feed -Forward Networks: Each encoder and decoder layer have a fully connected 
feed-forward network in addition to attention sub -layers. This feed -forward network is applied to 
each position independently and in the same way. This is made up of two linear transformations 
connected  by a ReLU activation.  
𝐹𝐹𝑁(𝑥)= 𝑚𝑎𝑥(0,𝑥𝑊1 +𝑏1)𝑊2 + 𝑏2                                                                                             (19) 
Positional Encoding: Since the Transformer model does not rely on recurrence or convolution, it 
requires a way to capture the relative or absolute positions of tokens within a sequence to effectively 
utilize the sequence's order. To address this, positional encoding is introdu ced at the input level of 
both the encoder and decoder stacks. These positional encodings are added to the input embeddings, 
as they share the same dimensionality, 𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙 . This combination enables the model to incorporate 
positional information, allowing it to better understand the sequential nature of the data  [148].

Positional encodings in transformer architecture were achieved by using sine and cosine 
functions of various frequencies:  
{𝑃𝐸(𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖) = 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑝𝑜𝑠/100002𝑖/𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙)               
𝑃𝐸(𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖+1) = 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑝𝑜𝑠/100002𝑖/𝑑𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙)                                                                                       (20) 
where 𝑝𝑜𝑠 is the position and 𝑖 is the dimension. Every dimension of the positional encoding 
has a sinusoidal relationship. The wavelengths range from 2𝜋 𝑡𝑜 10000·2𝜋 in a geometric 
development. This function was selected because it would make it simple for the model to learn 
how to attend to relative positions, since for any fixed offset 𝑘, 𝑃𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠+𝑘 can be expressed as a 
linear function of 𝑃𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠. 
5.1 Transformer  Variants  
The Transformer  architecture has proven to be highly versatile, with numerous variants 
developed to address specific challenges across different domains. Typically, Transformers are pre -
trained on large datasets using unsupervised methods to learn general representations , which are 
then fine -tuned on specific tasks using supervised learning. This hybrid approach leverages the 
strengths of both learning paradigms. Some notable Transformer variants include:  
➢ Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT ) [155]: A multi -layer 
bidirectional Transformer encoder for unsupervised pre -training in natural language 
understanding (NLU) tasks.  
➢ Generative pre -training Transformer (GPT)  [156, 157]: A type of Transformer model 
developed by OpenAI that excels in natural language processing (NLP) tasks through 
unsupervised pre -training followed by supervised fine -tuning . 
➢ Transformer -XL [158]: It is proposed for language modeling to permit learning reliance 
beyond a set length without compromising temporal coherence. Transformer -XL 
(Transformer -Extra Long) comprises a unique relative  positional encoding method and a 
segment -level recurrence mechanism. This approach not only makes it possible to record 
longer -term dependencies, but also fixes the issue of context fragmentation.  
➢ XLNet [159]: It is a generalized autoregressive (AR) pretraining technique that combines the 
benefits of autoencoding (AE) and autoregressive (AR) techniques with a permutation 
language modeling aim. XLNet's neural architecture, which integrates Transformer -XL and the  
two-stream attention mechanism, is built to function effortlessly with the autoregressive (AR) 
objective.       
➢ Fast Transformer  [160]: It introduces multi -query attention as an alternative to multi -head 
attention. This approach reduces memory bandwidth requirements, leading to increased 
processing speed.  
➢ Multimodal Transformer (MulT)  [161]: It is designed for analyzing human multimodal 
language. At the heart of MulT is the crossmodal attention mechanism, which provides a latent 
crossmodal adaptation that fuses multimodal information by directly attending to low -level 
features in other modalities . 
➢ Vision Transformer (ViT)  [162]: An innovative approach based on Transformer structure for 
visual tasks like image classification.  
➢ Pyramid Vision Transformer  (PVT)  [163]: An Transformer framework for complex 
prediction tasks like semantic segmentation and object recognition . 
➢ Swin Transformer  [164]: A hierarchical transformer that uses shifted windows to construct 
its representation.  A wide variety of vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, object 
detection, and image classification, may be performed with Swin Transformer.  
➢ Tokens -to-Token  Vision Transformer (T2T -ViT)  [165]: A vision transformer that can be  
x                                                                      JAI, 202 4 
trained from scratch on ImageNet.  T2T-ViT overcomes ViT's  drawbacks by accurately 
modeling the structural information of images and enhancing feature richness.  
➢ Transformer in Transformer (TNT)  [166]: A vision transformer for visual recognition . Both 
local and global representation s are extracted by the TNT architecture through the use of an 
inner  transformer and an outer transformer.  
➢ PyramidTNT [167]: A improve d TNT model which used pyramid architecture, and 
convolutional stem  in order to greatly enhance the original TNT model.  
➢ Switch Transformers  [168]: It is suggested as a straightforward and computationally effective 
method of increasing a Transformer model's parameter count.  
➢ ConvNeXt [169]: A redesigned transformer architecture that makes use of the transformer 
attention mechanism and incorporates convolutional layers into the encoder and decoder 
modules to extract spatially localized data.  
➢ Evolutionary  Algorithm  Transformer  (EATFormer ) [170]: An improved vision 
transformer influenced by an evolutionary algorithm.  
6 Deep Reinforcement Learning  
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning approach that deals with sequential 
decision -making, aiming to map situations to actions in a way that maximizes the associated reward. 
Unlike supervised learning, where explicit instructions are given afte r each system action, in the 
RL framework, the learner, known as an agent, is not provided with explicit guidance on which 
actions to take at each timestep 𝑡. The RL agent must explore through trial and error to determine 
which actions yield the highest r ewards [171]. Furthermore, unlike supervised learning, where the 
correct output is obtained and the model is updated based on the loss or error, RL uses gradients 
without a differentiable loss function to teach a model to explore randomly and learn to make 
optimal dec isions [172]. Fig. 23 depicts the agent -environment interaction in reinforcement 
learning (RL). The standard theoretical framework for RL is based on a Markov Decision Process 
(MDP), which extends the concept of a Markov process and is used to model decision -making 
based on states, actions, and rewards  [173]. 
Deep reinforcement learning combines the decision -making capabilities of reinforcement 
learning with the perception function of deep learning. It is considered a form of "real AI" as it 
aligns more closely with human thinking. Fig. 24 illustrates the basic structure of deep 
reinforcement learning, where deep learning processes sensory inputs from the environment and 
provides the current state data. The reinforcement learning process then links the current state to 
the appropriate actio n and evaluates values based on anticipated rewards  [174, 175]. 
 
 
JAI, 202 4                                                                             x

Figure 24.  Basic structure of  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL ) [174]. 
 
One of the most renowned deep reinforcement learning models is the Deep Q -learning 
Network (DQN) [176], which directly learns policies from high -dimensional inputs using 
Convolutional Neural Network  (CNN). Other common models in deep reinforcement learning 
include Double DQN [177], Dueling DQN [178], and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) [179]. 
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models find applications in various domains, such as 
video game playing  [180, 181], robotic manipulation [182, 183], image segmentation [184, 185], 
video analysis [186, 187], energy management [188, 189], and more.  
7 Deep Transfer Learning  
Deep neural networks have significantly improved performance across various machine 
learning tasks and applications. However, achieving these remarkable performance gains often 
requires large amounts of labeled data for supervised learning, as it relies on  capturing the latent 
patterns within the data [190]. Unfortunately, in certain specialized domains, the availability of 
sufficient training data is a major challenge. Constructing a large -scale, high -quality annotated 
dataset is costly and time -consuming [191]. 
To address the issue of limited training data, transfer learning (TL) has emerged as a crucial 
tool in machine learning. The concept of transfer learning finds its roots in educational psychology, 
where the theory of generalization suggests that transferring knowledge from one context to another 
is facilitated by generalizin g experiences. To achieve successful transfer, there needs to be a 
connection between the two learning tasks. For example, someone who has learned to play the 
violin is likely to learn t he piano more quickly due to the shared characteristics between musical 
instruments [192]. Fig. 25 depicts the learning process of transfer learning. Deep transfer learning  
(DTL) makes use of the learning experience to reduce the time and effort needed to train large 
networks as well as the time and effort needed to create the weights for an entire network from 
scratch [193]. 
With the growing popularity of deep neural networks in various fields, numerous deep transfer 
learning techniques have been proposed. Deep transfer learning can be categorized into four main 
types based on the techniques employed  [191]: instances -based deep transfer learning, mapping -
based (feature -based ) deep transfer learning, network -based  (model -based ) deep transfer learning, 
 
x                                                                      JAI, 202 4 
and adversarial -based deep transfer learning.  
 
Figure 25.  Learning process of transfer learning.  
 
Instances -based deep transfer learning involves selecting a subset of instances from the source 
domain and assigning appropriate weight values to these selected instances to supplement the 
training set in the target domain. Algorithms such as TaskTrAdaBoos t [194] and TrAdaBoost.R2 
[195] are well -known approaches based on this strategy.  
Mapping -based deep transfer learning focuses on mapping instances from both the source and 
target domains into a new data space, where instances from the two domains exhibit similarity and 
are suitable for training a unified deep neural network. Successful  methods based on this approach 
include Extend MMD  (Maximum Mean Discrepancy ) [196], and MK-MMD  (Multiple Kernel 
variant of MMD ) [197]. 
Network -based (model -based) deep transfer learning involves reusing a segment of a pre -
trained network from the source domain, including its architecture and connection parameters, and 
applying it to a deep neural network in the target domain. These model -based approaches are highly 
effective for domain adaptation between source and target data by adjusting the network (model), 
making them the most widely adopted strategies in deep transfer learning (DTL). Remarkably, 
these methods can even adapt target data that is significantly different from the  source data  [198].  
Network -based (model-based ) approaches in deep transfer learning typically involve pre -
training, freezing, fine -tuning, and adding new layers. Pre -trained models consist of layers from a 
deep learning network (DL model) that have been trained using source data. Two key methods for 
training a mode l with target data are freezing and fine -tuning. These methods involve using some 
or all layers of a pre -defined model. When layers are frozen, they retain fixed parameters/weights 
from the pre -trained model. In con trast, fine -tuning involves initializing parameters and weights 
with pre -trained values instead of starting with random values, either for the entire network or 
specific layers [198]. 
A recent advancement in model -based deep transfer learning  is Progressive Neural Networks 
(PNNs). This strategy involves the freezing of a pre -trained model and integrating new layers 
specifically for training on target data [199]. The concept behind progressive learning is grounded 
in the idea that acquiring a new skill necessitates leveraging existing knowledge. This mirrors the 
way humans learn new abilities. For instance, a child learns to run by employing all the skills 
acquir ed during crawling and walking. PNN constructs a new model for each task it encounters. 
 
JAI, 202 4                                                                             x 
Each freshly generated model is interconnected with all others, aiming to learn a new task by 
applying the knowledge accumulated from preceding model s. 
Adversarial -based methods focus on gathering transferable features from both the source and 
target data by leveraging logical relationships or rules acquired in the source domain. Alternatively, 
they may utilize techniques inspired by generative adversaria l networks (GANs) [200].   
These deep transfer learning techniques have proven to be effective in overcoming the 
challenge of limited training data, enabling knowledge transfer across domains, and facilitating 
improved performance in various applications  such as image classification  [201, 202], speech 
recognition [203, 204], video analysis [205, 206], signal processing  [207, 208], and other .  
In transfer learning, several popular pre -trained deep learning models are frequently used, 
including Xception [52], MobileNet [53], DenseNet [55], Efficient Net [57], NasNet [209], and 
among others. These models are initially trained on large -scale datasets like ImageNet, and their 
learned weights are then transferred to a target domain. The architectures of these networks reflect 
a broader trend in deep learning design, transitioning fr om manually crafted by human experts to 
automatically optimized patterns. This evolution focuses on striking a balance between model 
accuracy and computational complexity [210].  
8 Hybrid Deep Learning Models  
Hybrid deep learning architectures, which integrate elements from various deep learning 
models, demonstrate significant potential in enhancing performance. By combining different 
fundamental generative or discriminative models, the following three categories of hybrid deep 
learning models can be particularly effective for addressing real -world problems:  
• Combination of various supervised models to extract more relevant and robust features, such 
as CNN+LSTM  or CNN+GRU . By leveraging the strengths of different architectures, these 
hybrid models effectively capture both spatial and temporal dependencies within the data.  
• Integrating various types of generative models, such as combining Autoencoders (AE) with 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), to harness their strengths and enhance performance 
across a range of tasks.  
• Integrating the capabilities of generative models with supervised models to leverage the 
strengths of both approaches can significantly enhance performance on various tasks. This 
hybrid strategy improves feature learning, data augmentation, and model robus tness. Examples 
of such combinations include  DBN+MLP, GAN+CNN, AE+CNN, and so on.  
9 Application of Deep Learning  
In recent years, deep learning has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across a wide range 
of applications, tackling various challenges in fields including healthcare, computer vision, speech 
recognition, natural language processing (NLP), e -learning, sm art environments, and more. Fig. 2 6 
highlights several potential real -world application areas of deep learning . 
Five useful categories have been established for these applications: classification, detection, 
localization, segmentation, and regression [10]. A concept called classification divides a collection 
of facts into classes. Detection typically involves recognizing objects and their boundaries within 
images, videos, or other data types. Localization refers to the process of identifying and determinin g 
the position of specific objects or features within an image or other types of data. Segmentation 
involves dividing an image or dataset into distinct regions or segments, with each segment 
representing a particular object or feature of interest. Regressi on is used to model and analyze the 
relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It predicts 
continuous outcomes based on input features.

10 Deep Learning Challenges  
While deep learning models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, they 
also come with significant challenges. Below are some of the most critical challenges, followed by 
potential solutions to address them.  
10.1 Insufficient Data  
Deep learning models require large amounts of data to perform well. The performance of these 
models typically improves as the volume of data increases. However, in many cases, sufficient data 
may not be available, making it difficult to train deep learning  models effectively [10].  
Three possible approaches may be used to appropriately handle the insufficient data problem. 
The first method is Transfer Learning (TL), which is used to DL models by reusing pre -trained 
model pieces in new models. We thoroughly reviewed the transfer learni ng strategy in section 7.  
Data augmentation is the second method of gathering additional data. The goal of data 
augmentation is to improve the trained models' capacity for generalization. Generalization is 
necessary for networks to overcome small datasets or datasets with unequal c lass distributions, and 
it is especially crucial for real -world data  [259]. There are several strategies for augmenting data, 
and each one is contingent upon the characteristics of the datasets  [260]. A few of these techniques 
are geometric transformations [261], Mixup augmentation  [262], Random oversampling [263], 
Feature space augmentation [264], generative data augmentation  [265], and many more.  
 The third approach considers using simulated data to increase the training set's volume. If 
you have a good understanding of the physical process, you can sometimes build simulators from 
it. Consequently, the outcome will include simulating as much data as  necessary  [10, 266].    
 
10.2 Imbalanced Data 
In real -world situations, particularly in those that deep learning models address, the issue of 
class imbalance is common. If the majority of instances in the data set belong to one class and the 
remaining instances belong to the other class, then there is  a class imbalance in a binary 
classification scenario. In multi -class, multi -label, multi -instance learning as well as in regression 
difficulties and other situations, class imbalances are present and are actually reinforced [267].  
It has been determined that there are three main approaches to address ing imbalanced data: 
data-level techniques, algorithm -level techniques, and hybrid techniques. The focus  of data -level 
techniques is to add or remove samples from training sets in order to balance the data distributions. 
These techniques balance the data distributions by adding new samples to the minority class 
(oversampling) or removing samples from the majority class (undersampling)  [268, 269]. A variety 
of oversampling techniques, including Synthetic Minority Over -sampl ing Technique (SMOTE) 
[270], Borderline -SMOTE [271], Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) [272], SVM  (Support Vector 
Machine )-SMOTE  [273], Majority Weighted Minority Oversampling Technique (MWMOTE) 
[274], Sampling With the Majority (SWIM) [275], Reverse -SMOTE (R -SMOTE) [276], 
Constrained Oversampling (CO) [277], SMOTE Based on Furthest Neighbor Algorithm 
(SOMTEFUNA)  [278], and many more can be used to solve imbalanced data problems. Also, there 
are several techniques for undersampling, including EasyEnsemble [279], BalanceCascade [279], 
Inverse  Random Undersampling [280], MLP -based Undersampling Technique (MLPUS) [281], 
and others.  
Algorithm -level approaches modify existing learning algorithms to mitigate the bias towards 
the majority class. These techniques require specialized knowledge of both the application domain 
and the learning algorithm to diagnose why a classifier fails unde r imbalanced class distributions 
[268]. Two of the most commonly used methods in this context are Cost-Sensitive Learning [282, 
283] and One-Class Learning [284].  
JAI, 202 4                                                                             x 
The third approach consists of hybrid methods, which combine  algorithm -level techniques 
with data -level methods in the appropriate way.  Hybridization is required to address issues with 
algorithm and data -level approaches and improve classification accuracy [285].     
 
10.3 Overfitting  
Overfitting occurs when a deep learning model learns the systematic and noise components of 
the training data to the point that it adversely affects the model's performance on new data.  In fact, 
overfitting occurs as a result of  noise, the small size of the training set, and the complexity of the 
classifiers.  Overfitted models tend to memorize all the data, including the inevitable noise in the 
training set, rather than understanding the underlying patterns in the data  [24]. Overfitting is 
addressed with methods including dropout [92], weight decay [286], batch normalization [287, 
288], regularization [289], data augmentation,  and others,  although determining the ideal balance 
is still difficult.  
 
10.4 Vanishing  and Exploding Gradient  
In deep neural networks, the computation of gradients is propagated layer by layer, leading to 
a phenomenon known as the vanishing or exploding gradient problem. As gradients are 
backpropagated through the network, they can exponentially diminish or grow, respectively, 
causing significant issues in training. When gradients vanish, the weights of the network are 
adjusted so minimally that the model's learning process becomes exceedingly slow, potentially 
stalling altogether. Conversely, exploding gradients c an cause weights to be updated excessively, 
leading to instability and divergence during training. This problem is particularly pronounced with 
non-linear activation functions such as sigmoid and tanh, which compress the output into a narrow 
range, further  exacerbating the issue by limiting the gradient's magnitude. Consequently, the model 
struggles to learn effectively, especially in deep networks where gradients must pass through many 
layers [8]. 
To mitigate the vanishing and exploding gradient problem, several strategies have been 
developed. One effective approach is to use the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, 
which does not saturate and therefore helps to maintain the gradient fl ow throughout the network  
[290]. Proper weight initialization techniques, such as Xavier initialization [291] can also reduce 
the likelihood of gradient issues by ensuring that initial weights are set in a way that prevents 
gradients from becoming too small or too large  [292]. Another solution is batch normalization, 
which normalizes the inputs of each layer to maintain a stable distribution of activations throughout 
training. By doing so, batch normalization helps to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and 
can accelerate  convergence by reducing internal covariate shift s. Overall, addressing the vanishing 
and exploding gradient problem is crucial for training deep neural networks effectively, enabling 
them to learn complex patterns without succumbing to instability or inefficiency  [288]. 
 
10.5 Catastrophic Forgetting  
Catastrophic forgetting is a critical challenge in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence 
within neural networks. It occurs when a model, after being trained on a new task, loses its ability 
to perform previously learned tasks. This phenomenon is p articularly problematic in scenarios 
where a model is expected to learn sequentially across multiple tasks without forgetting earlier ones, 
such as in lifelong learning or continual learning applications. The root cause of catastrophic 
forgetting lies like neural networks, which update their weights based on new training data. When 
trained on a new task, the model adjusts its parameters to optimize performance on that task, often 
at the expense of previously acquired knowledge. As a result, the model may ex hibit excellent 
performance on the most recent task but perform poorly on earlier ones, effectively "forgetting"  
x                                                                      JAI, 202 4 
them  [293]. 
Several strategies have been proposed to address catastrophic forgetting. One such approach 
is Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)  [294], which penalizes changes to the weights that are 
important for previous tasks, thereby preserving learned knowledge while allowing the model to 
adapt to new tasks. Incremental Moment Matching (IMM)  ) [295] is another technique that merges 
models trained on different tasks into a single model, balancing the performance across all tasks.  
The iCaRL (incremental Classifier and Representation Learning) [296] method combines 
classification with representation learning, enabling the model to learn new classes without 
forgetting previously learned ones. Additionally, the Hard Attention to the Task (HAT) [293] 
approach employs task -specific masks that prevent interference between tasks, reducing the 
likelihood of forgetting.  
 
10.6 Underspecifcation  
Underspecification  is an emerging challenge in the deployment of machine learning (ML) 
models, particularly deep learning (DL) models, in real -world applications. It refers to the 
phenomenon where an ML pipeline can produce a multitude of models that all perform well on the  
validation set but exhibit unpredictable behavior in deployment. This issue arises because the 
pipeline's design does not fully specify which model characteristics are critical for generalization 
in real -world scenarios. The underspecification problem is often linked to the high degrees of 
freedom inherent in ML pipelines. Factors such as random seed initialization, hyperparameter 
selection, and the stochastic nature of training can lead to the creation of models with similar 
validation performance but div ergent behaviors in production. These differences can manifest as 
inconsistent predictions when the model is exposed to new data or deployed in environments 
different from the training conditions [297]. 
Addressing underspecification requires rigorous testing and validation beyond standard 
metrics. Stress tests, as proposed by D’Amour et al. [297], are designed to evaluate a model's 
robustness under various real -world conditions, identifying potential failure points that may not be 
apparent during standard validation. These tests simulate different deployment scenarios, such as 
varying input distri butions or environmental changes, to assess how the model's predictions might 
vary. Moreover, some research es have been conducted to analyze and mitigate underspecification 
across different ML tasks  [298, 299].  
11 Analysis of Deep Learning Models  
This section details the methodology used in this study, which focuses on applying and 
evaluating various deep learning models for classification tasks across three distinct datasets. For 
our experimental analysis, we utilized three publicly available data sets: IMDB [300], ARAS [301], 
and Fruit -360 [302]. The objective is to conduct a comparative analysis of the performance of these 
deep learning models.  
The IMDB dataset, which stands for Internet Movie Database, provides a collection of movie 
reviews categorized as positive or negative sentiments. ARAS is a dataset comprising annotated 
sensor events for human activity recognition tasks. Fruit -360 is a dat aset consisting of images of 
various fruit types for classification purposes.  
We began by evaluating eight different models: CNN, RNN, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, 
GRU, Bidirectional GRU, TCN, and Transformer on the IMDB and ARAS datasets. Our analysis 
aimed to compare the performance of these deep learning models across diverse  datasets. The CNN 
model (Convolutional Neural Network) is particularly effective in capturing spatial dependencies, 
making it suitable for tasks involving structured data. RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is well -
suited for sequential data analysis, while L STM (Lo ng Short -Term Memory) and GRU (Gated 
Recurrent Unit) models are designed to capture long -term dependencies in sequential data. The  
JAI, 202 4                                                                             x 
Bidirectional LSTM and Bidirectional GRU models provide an additional advantage by processing 
information in both forward and backward directions.  
Additionally, we evaluated eight different CNN -based models: VGG, Inception, ResNet, 
InceptionResNet, Xception, MobileNet, DenseNet, and NASNet for the classification of fruit 
images using the Fruit -360 dataset. Given that image data is not sequential or t ime-dependent, 
recurrent models were not suitable for this task. CNN -based models are particularly effective for 
image analysis because of their ability to capture spatial dependencies. Moreover, the faster training 
time of CNN models is due to their parallel processing capabilities, which allow  for efficient 
computation on GPU  (Graphics Processing Unit ), thereby accelerating the training process.  
To evaluate the performance of these models, we employed assessment metrics such as 
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 -measure. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the 
model's predictions, while precision evaluates the proportion of correctly pre dicted positive 
instances. Recall assesses the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances, and F1 -
measure provides a balanced measure of precision and recall.

Where 𝑇𝑝 = True Positive, 𝑇𝑛 = True Negative, 𝐹𝑝 = False Positive, and 𝐹𝑛 = False

By conducting a comprehensive analysis using these metrics, we can gain insights into the 
strengths and weaknesses of each deep learning model. This comparative evaluation enables us to 
identify the most effective model for specific datasets and applicatio ns, ultimately advancing the 
field of deep learning and its practical applications.  
All experiments were conducted on a GeForce RTX 3050 GPU  (Graphics Processing Unit ) 
with 4 Gigabyte  of RAM (Random Access Memory ). 
11.1 Methodology and Experiments  on IMDB Dataset  
The IMDB dataset is a widely used dataset for sentiment analysis tasks. It consists of movie 
reviews along with their corresponding binary sentiment polarity labels. The dataset contains a total 
of 50,000 reviews, evenly split into 25,000 training samples and 25,000 testing samples. There is 
an equal distribution of positive and negative labels, with 25,000 instances of each sentiment. To 
reduce the correlation between reviews for a given movie, only 30 reviews are included in the 
dataset [300]. Positive reviews often contain words like "great," "well," and "love," while negative 
reviews frequently use words like "bad" and "can't." However, certain words such as "one," 
"character," and "well" appear frequently in both positive and negative revie ws, although their 
usage may differ in terms of frequency between the two sentiment classes [72].  
In our analysis, we employed eight different deep learning models including CNN, RNN, 
LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional GRU, TCN, and Transformer for sentiment 
classification using the IMDB dataset.  Fig. 2 7 presents a structural overview of the deep learning 
model intended for analyzing the performance of eight different models on the IMDB dataset.  
  
x                                                                      JAI, 202 4 
 
Figure 2 7.  The structural for  analysis of different deep learning models on IMDB dataset  
 
In this architecture, text data is first passed through an embedding layer, which transforms the 
high-dimensional, sparse input into dense, lower -dimensional vectors of real numbers. This allows 
the model to capture semantic relationships within the data. In the second layer, one of eight models: 
CNN, RNN, LSTM, Bi -LSTM, GRU, Bi -GRU, TCN, or Transformer is employed for feature 
extraction and data training. This layer is crucial for capturing patterns and dependencies in the 
data. Following this, a dropout l ayer is included to address the issue of overfitting by randomly 
deactivating a portion of the neurons during training, which helps improve the model's 
generalization. Subsequently, the multi -dimensional vector turns into a one -dimensional vector 
using a flatten layer, enabling it to work with fully connected layers. Finally, the output is passed 
through a fully connected (Dense) layer, which uses a Softmax function for classification, 
converting the model's predictions into probabilities for each class.  
Building a neural network with high accuracy necessitates careful attention to hyperparameter 
selection, as these adjustments significantly influence the network's performance. For example, 
setting the number of training iterations too high can lead to ove rfitting, where the model performs 
well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Another critical hyperparameter is the learning 
rate, which affects the rate of convergence during training. If the learning rate is too high, the 
network may converge too quickly, potentially overshooting the global minimum of the loss 
function. Conversely, if the learning rate is too low, the convergence process may become 
excessively slow, prolonging training. Therefore, finding the optimal balance of hyperparameters 
is essential for maximizing the network's performance and ensuring effective learning.  
In the experiment phase, consistent parameters were applied across all models to ensure a 
standardized comparison. The parameters were set as follows: epochs = 30, batch size = 64, dropout 
= 0.2, with the loss function set to "Binary Crossentropy," and the  optimizer function set to 
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.2. For the CNN model, 100 filters 
were used with a kernel size of 3, along with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. 
The RNN, LSTM, Bi -LSTM, GRU, and Bi -GRU models each employed 64 units. The TCN model 
was configured with 16 filters, a kernel size of 5, and dilation rates of [1, 2, 4, 8]. The Transformer 
 
JAI, 202 4                                                                             x 
model was set up with 2 attention heads, a hidden layer size of 64 in the feed -forward network, and 
the ReLU activation function. These parameter settings and architectural choices were designed to 
allow for a standardized comparison of the deep learning m odels on the IMDB dataset. This 
standardization facilitates an accurate analysis of each model's performance, enabling a comparison 
of their accuracy and loss values.

various metrics including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 -Score, and Time of training.

To compare the performance of these models, we utilized accuracy, validation -accuracy, loss, 
and validation -loss diagrams. These diagrams provide insights into how well the models are 
learning from the data and help in evaluating their effectiveness for sentiment classification tasks.  
 Fig. 28  shows the accuracy and validation -accuracy diagrams where the accuracy, provides 
a visual representation of how the different deep learning models perform in terms of accuracy 
during the training process and validation -accuracy shows the trend of accuracy  values on the 
testing set across multiple epochs for each model.

loss diagram  depicts the variation in loss values on the testing set during the evaluation process for 
the different models. The loss function measures the discrepancy between the predicted sentiment 
labels and the actual labels.  
Furthermore, the confusion matrices for the various deep learning models are displayed in  Fig. 
30. These matrices provide a detailed breakdown of each model's performance, highlighting how 
well the models classify different classes. By closely examining these confusion matrices, we can 
gain insights into the precision of the models and identify patter ns of misclassification for each 
class. This analysis helps in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the models' predictions.

Additionally, Fig. 31  displays the ROC -AUC  (Receiver Operating Characteristic -Area Under 
Curve ) diagrams for eight different deep learning models. These diagrams offer valuable insights 
into the classification performance of the models, aiding in the assessment of their effectiveness. 
By analyzing the ROC -AUC curves, we can make informed decisions re garding model selection 
and threshold adjustments, ensuring a more accurate and effective classification approach.  
Based on the results provided, it can be concluded that the Transformer and Bi -GRU models 
achieved the best performance on the IMDB review dataset for sentiment analysis. Both models 
demonstrated high accuracy in classifying the sentiment of movie reviews.  However, it is worth 
noting that the training time of the Transformer model was significantly less than that of the Bi -
GRU model. This suggests that the Transformer model was faster to train compared to the Bi -GRU 
model while still achieving excellent per formance. Additionally, the GRU model also exhibited 
good accuracy in sentiment classification and required less training time than the Bi -GRU model. 
Overall, the results suggest that the Transformer, and GRU models are effective deep learning 
models for s entiment analysis on the IMDB review dataset, with varying trade -offs between 
performance and training time.  
11.2 Methodology and Experiments  on ARAS Dataset  
Based on the provided information, the ARAS dataset [301] is a valuable resource for 
recogni zing human activities in smart environments. It consists of data streams collected from two 
houses over a period of 60 days, with 20 binary sensors installed to monitor resident activity. The 
dataset includes information on 27 different activities performed by  two residents, and the sensor 
events are recorded on a per -second basis.   
Eight distinct deep learning models were used in our investigation to recognize human 
activities: CNN, RNN, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional GRU, TCN, and 
Transformer. A structural overview of the deep learning model designed to analyze the 
performance of eight different models on the ARAS dataset is shown in Fig. 32. 
The first phase involves preprocessing the sensor data to ensure it is in a suitable and 
standardized format for deep learning models. The initial task in this phase is data cleaning, where 
any recorded instances where all sensor events are zero, and the r esident is inside the house, are 
 
x                                                                      JAI, 202 4 
removed from the dataset. Next, a time -based static sliding window technique is applied for 
segmenting sensor events. This method groups sequences of sensor events into intervals of equal 
duration. Optimizing the time interval is crucial for effective segm entation; after evaluating 
intervals ranging from 30 to 360 seconds, a 90 -second interval was determined to be optimal for 
the ARAS dataset. The segmentation task aids in decreasing training time and increasing accuracy 
for the deep learning models.  
 
 
Figure 3 2.  The structural for analysis of different deep learning models on the ARAS dataset  
 
After preprocessing, the data is passed through an input layer. In the second layer, one of eight 
models: CNN, RNN, LSTM, Bi -LSTM, GRU, Bi -GRU, TCN, or Transformer is employed for 
feature extraction and training. This layer plays a vital role in capturing patterns and dependencies 
within the data. To mitigate overfitting, a dropout layer follows, which randomly deactivates a 
portion of the neurons during training, thereby improving the model's generalization. Subsequently, 
a flatten layer is used to convert  the multi -dimensional vector into a one -dimensional vector, 
making it compatible with fully connected layers. Finally, the output passes through a fully 
connected (Dense) layer, which uses a Softmax function for classification, transforming the 
model’s pr edictions into probability distributions across the classes.   
In the experimental phase, we split the data from the first resident of house B, allocating 70% 
for training and 30% for testing, using a random split. Additionally, 20% of the training data was 
set aside for validation. The models were trained with a fixe d set of parameters: 30 epochs, a batch 
size of 64, a dropout rate of 0.2, the "Categorical Crossentropy" loss function, and the Adam 
optimizer. For the CNN model, we used 100 filters with a kernel size of 3 and the rectified linear 
unit (ReLU) activation function. The RNN, LSTM, Bi -LSTM, GRU, and Bi -GRU models were 
configured with 64 units each. The TCN model was set with 16 filters, a kernel size of 5, and 
dilation rates of [1, 2, 4, 8]. The Transformer model utilized 2 attention heads, a hidden layer siz e 
of 64 in the feedforward network, and the ReLU activation function.

Since we performed preprocessing tasks like data cleaning and segmentation, the data is nearly 
normalized and balanced, leading to consistent and closely grouped results across all models. 
However, the results indicate that the Transformer and TCN models o utperformed the others on 
the ARAS dataset. This outcome aligns with the dataset's nature, which comprises spatial and 
temporal sequences of sensor events. Among the models, the Transformer exhibited the highest 
performance in terms of accuracy, recall, an d F1-score, while the Bi -LSTM model excelled in the 
precision metric. Moreover, the Transformer model demonstrated a notable advantage in training 
time, second only to the CNN model, underscoring its efficiency in processing and learning from 
time-series data. Additionally, when examining the accuracy and loss curves, it is evident that t he 
Transformer, TCN, and CNN models stabilized earlier than the others. Overall, the Transformer 
model proved to be the most effective for working with the ARAS dataset, st riking a balance 
between accuracy, training time, and consistency throughout the training phases, making it the 
optimal choice for recognizing human activities based on sensor data.   
11.3 Methodology and Experiments  on the Fruit -360 Dataset  
Since images are not sequential or time -dependent, recurrent models were less effective for 
these tasks. CNN -based models, on the other hand, are highly valuable for image analysis due to 
their ability to capture spatial relationships. Consequently, the an alysis of deep learning models on 
the Fruit -360 dataset for image classification focused on eight CNN variants: VGG, Inception, 
ResNet, InceptionResNet, Xception, MobileNet, DenseNet, and NASNet.  These models use deep 
transfer learning technique for traini ng image data and improving  classification accuracy.  Fig. 35 
provides a structural overview of the deep learning models used to evaluate the performance of 
these eight variants on the Fruit -360 dataset.

First, the fruit images are passed through an input layer. In the second layer, one of eight 
models  (VGG, Inception, ResNet, InceptionResNet, Xception, MobileNet, DenseNet, or NASNet ) 
is employed for feature extraction and training. Next, a Global Average Pooling 2D (GAP) layer is 
applied, which significantly reduces the spatial dimensions of the data by collapsing each feature 
map into a single value. To combat overfitting, a dropout l ayer is then introduced, randomly 
deactivating a portion of the neurons during training, which enhances the model's ability to 
generalize. Finally, the output is passed through a fully connected (Dense) layer, where a Softmax 
function is used to classify t he fruit images.  
The dataset comprises 55,244 images of 81 different fruit classes, each with a resolution of 
100 × 100 pixels. For the experiments, a subset of 60 fruit classes was selected, containing 28,484 
images for training and 9,558 images for testing. Non -fruit ite ms such as chestnuts and ginger root 
were removed from the dataset.  
All models were trained with a consistent set of parameters: 20 epochs, a batch size of 512, a 
dropout rate of 0.2, the "Categorical Crossentropy" loss function, and the Adam optimizer. 
Additionally, all models utilized the “ImageNet ” dataset for pre -training.  
Table 4 presents the experimental results for various models on the Fruit -360 dataset, 
including VGG16, InceptionV3, ResNet50, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, MobileNet, 
DenseNet121, and NASNetLarge. The table includes metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall,  
F1-Score, and Time of training .

Furthermore, the accuracy, validation -accuracy, loss, and validation -loss diagrams were used 
to compare the performance of various models. When assessing the models' performance for tasks 
involving the categorization of fruit photos, these graphs offer valuable insights into how 
effectively the models are learning from the data.   Fig. 3 6 shows the accuracy and validation -
accuracy diagram of the deep learning models, while Fig. 3 7 illustrates the loss diagram and 
validation -loss diagram of the deep learning models.  
Based on the results, it can be concluded that the DenseNet and MobileNet models achieved 
the best performance for fruit image classification on the Fruit -360 dataset. Both models 
demonstrated high accuracy in classifying fruit images. Notably, MobileNet h ad a significantly 
shorter training time compared to DenseNet, indicating that it was faster to train while still 
delivering performance close to that of DenseNet. Additionally, the Xception model also showed 
good accuracy and required less training time t han DenseNet. Overall, the MobileNet model stands 
out as a favorable choice due to its balance between accuracy and training efficiency.

12 Research Directions and Future Aspects   
In the preceding sections, we explored a range of deep learning topics, highlighting both the 
advantages and limitations of various deep learning models. Additionally, we examined the 
application of several models across different domains. Despite the bene fits demonstrated, our 
research has identified certain gaps, indicating that further advancements are necessary. This 
section outlines potential future research directions based on our analysis.  
- Generative (Unsupervised) Models:  Generative models, a key category of deep learning 
models discussed in Section 4, hold significant promise for future research. These models enable 
the creation of new data representations through exploratory analysis and can identify high -order 
correlatio ns or features in data. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised models can derive 
insights from data without the need for labeled examples, making them valuable for various 
applications. Several generative models, includi ng Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial 
Networks (GANs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), and Self -Organizing Maps (SOMs), have been 
developed and employed across diverse contexts.  A promising research avenue involves analyzing 
these models in various settings and developing new methods or variations that enhance data 
modeling or representation for specific real -world applications. The rising interest in GANs is

particularly noteworthy, as they excel in leveraging unlabeled image data for deep representation 
learning and training highly non -linear mappings between latent and data spaces. The GAN 
framework offers the flexibility to formulate new theories and method s tailored to emerging deep 
learning applications, positioning it as a pivotal area for future exploration.  
- Hybrid/Ensemble Modeling : Hybrid deep learning architectures have shown great potential in 
enhancing model performance by combining components from multiple models. For instance, the 
integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) 
can capt ure both temporal and spatial dependencies in data, leveraging the strengths of each model. 
Hybrid models also benefit from combining generative and supervised learning, offering superior 
performance and improved uncertainty handlin g in high -risk scenarios. Developing effective 
hybrid models, whether supervised or unsupervised, presents a significant research opportunity to 
address a wide range of real -world problems, including semi -supervised learning tasks and model 
uncertainty. Th is approach moves beyond conventional, isolated models, emphasizing the need for 
sophisticated methods that can handle the complexity of various data types and applications.  
- Hyperparameter Optimization for Efficient Deep Learning : As deep learning models have 
evolved, the number of parameters, computational latency, and resource requirements have 
increased substantially [152]. Selecting the appropriate hyperparameters is critical to building a 
neural network with high accuracy. Key hyperparameters include learning rate, loss function, batch 
size, number of training iterations, and dropout rate, among others. The challenge lies  in finding an 
optimal balance of these parameters, as they significantly influence network performance. However, 
iterating through all possible combinations of hyperparameters is computationally expensive. To 
address this, metaheuristic optimization techn iques, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) [303], Particle 
Swarm Optimization (PSO) [304], and others, can be employed to explore the search space more 
efficiently than exhaustive methods.  Future research should focus on optimizing hyperparameters 
tailored to specific data types and contexts. For example, the learning rate plays a crucial role in 
training, where a rate too high may cause the model to converge prematurely, while a rate too lo w 
can lead to slow convergence and prolonged training times. Adaptive learning rate techniques, such 
as including Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) [305], Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) [306], 
adaptive gradient algorithm (ADAGRAD) [307], and Nesterov -accelerated Adaptive Moment 
Estimation (Nadam) [308], and more recent innovations like Evolved Sign Momentum (Lion) [309], 
offer promising avenues for improving network performance and minimizing loss functions. Future 
research could further explore these optimizers, focusing on their comparative effectiveness in 
enhancing model performance through iterative weight and bias adjustments.  
- Federated Learning : Federated learning is an emerging deep learning paradigm that enables 
collaborative model training across multiple organizations or teams without the need to share raw 
data. This approach is particularly relevant in contexts where data privacy is paramoun t. However, 
federated learning introduces new challenges, especially with the advent of data fusion technologies 
that combine data from multiple sources with varying formats. As data diversity and volume 
continue to grow, optimizing data and model utilizat ion in federated learning becomes increasingly 
important. Addressing challenges such as safeguarding user privacy, developing universal models, 
and ensuring the stability of data fusion outcomes will be crucial for the future application of 
federated learn ing across multiple domains  [310]. 
- Quantum Deep Learning : Quantum computing and deep learning have both seen significant 
advancements over the past few decades. Quantum computing, which leverages the principles of 
quantum mechanics to store and process information, has the potential to outperform classical 
superc omputers on certain tasks, making it a powerful tool for complex problem -solving.  The 
intersection of quantum computing and deep learning has led to the emergence of quantum deep 
learning and quantum -inspired deep learning algorithms. Future research directions in this area 
include investigating and developing quantum deep learning mode ls, such as Quantum 
Convolutional Neural Network (Quantum CNN)  [311], Quantum Recurrent Neural Network  
x                                                                      JAI, 202 4 
(Quantum RNN)  [312], Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (Quantum GAN ) [313], and 
others. Additionally, exploring the application of these models across various domains and creating 
novel quantum deep learning architectures represents a cutting -edge frontier in the field  [314, 315].   
In conclusion, the research directions outlined above underscore the dynamic and evolving 
nature of deep learning. By addressing these challenges and exploring new avenues, the field can 
continue to advance, driving innovation and enabling the development of more powerful and 
efficient models for a wide range of applications.
